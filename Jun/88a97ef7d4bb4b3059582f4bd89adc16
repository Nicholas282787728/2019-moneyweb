RMB’s financing helped deliver the lowest tariff bid ever in South Africa. RMB’s inflation-linked debt product, used since the early rounds of the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement (Reippp) programme, has become the financing instrument of choice in the renewable energy sector, while its equity funding solutions help unlock significant value for many shareholders in the sector and the facilitation of new local players. Daniel Zinman, senior infrastructure finance transactor at RMB, talks to Moneyweb editor Ryk van Niekerk about the development of innovative funding models for the renewable energy sector.

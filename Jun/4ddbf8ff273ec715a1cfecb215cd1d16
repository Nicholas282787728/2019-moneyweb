Saving for retirement is a top priority for most investors. With life expectancies increasing, you will probably need to live off your savings for 20 years or more after you stop working. That means you will have to build up a retirement nest egg of many times your final annual salary. When the goal is this big and the consequences this important, itâ€™s vital that you make the right decisions about where and how to save. To do that, you should be guided by real, long-term evidence of what works. Fortunately, the evidence is easy to find. Many studies have shown overwhelmingly that investing in shares is the best way to grow your wealth ahead of inflation. But what does the evidence suggest is the most effective way of doing that?

A Moneyweb follow-the-money investigation into the sale of the 79 properties syndicated via the Highveld Syndication (HS) companies revealed that virtually all of these properties were sold to third parties before and shortly after the HS companies were put into business rescue. A previous article analysed the sale of 21 properties before the HS companies were put into business rescue in 2011. Moneyweb can now reveal, based on the analysis of the title deeds of the properties, that the disposal of properties to third parties in fact accelerated after the commencement of the business rescue process in December 2011.

Virtually all the properties were sold in 2013, although five – collectively valued at R328 million in the business rescue plan (BRP) – were sold within six months of the HS companies going into business rescue at the end of 2011. (The first property was sold back to property magnate and patron of the scheme Nic Georgiou within a few weeks; he then immediately sold it to a third party for a profit – see below.) The sale of these properties is in stark contradiction to the provisions in the BRP, penned by business rescue practitioner Hans Klopper. Klopper was also a director of Orthotouch. BRP and Section 155 Scheme of Arrangement To put the sale transactions in context, the original intent of the BRP needs to be revisited. The premise of the BRP was to transfer all the historic HS properties, as well as a few others, to one company named Orthotouch. An experienced team of property professionals would then manage the properties to generate the required income to repay investors. The directors of Orthotouch at the time were Georgiou, Panagiotis Kleovoulou, Klopper and Connie Myburgh. Myburgh is also chairman of the Nova Property Group, the rescue vehicle of the failed Sharemax investment scheme. The BRP gave the board the authority to sell “non-performing” properties and use the proceeds to maintain, upgrade and improve certain other “primary” centres to “maximise” investment returns for investors. This is contained in paragraph 2.3 of the Orthotouch business plan, which forms part of the BRP and reads: 2.3  The objective of Orthotouch is to maximize the investment return of shareholders and all stakeholders in Orthotouch by selling off the non-performing properties and utilizing the proceeds to redevelop primary shopping centres, such as Southdale in Johannesburg South, Piazza in Randburg, Forum in Sasolburg, Saveways In Witbank and Lyttelton Manor in Centurion. In addition Orthotouch will retain certain retail and commercial properties such as those in Charles Crescent in Sandton, Cell C in Sandton and Ethos in Parktown. However, despite this provision in the BRP, the primary properties and other retail and commercial properties described in the paragraph were sold shortly after the adoption of the BRP. Three of these properties were sold within six months, with the first (Southdale Shopping Centre) sold back to Georgiou’s company Zephan less than a month after the BRP was adopted. These primary properties were:  Property Name  BRP Valuation Date sold Price Third party 1 Southdale HS17 R164 192 090 2012/01/23 R208 000 000 Zephan/Serica Investments 2 Cell C HS22 R127 923 588 2012/02/29 R125 007 652 Annuity Properties 3 Ethos HS22 R59 168 700 2012/05/24 R46 000 000 Annuity Properties 4 12 and 13 Charles Crescent HS22 R19 896 800 2012/08/01 R23 000 000 Alchemy Properties 5 Lyttelton Centre HS18 R0 2012/08/06 R64 000 000 Rapfund Investments 6 The Piazza HS16 R105 000 000 2013/01/30 R148 000 000 Moxicorp Investments 7 Checkers Sasolburg HS15 R0 2013/04/23 R87 145 665 Luvon Investments, Ivory Pewter 90 8 1 Charles Crescent HS22 R107 044 630 2013/10/29 R110 805 516 Accelerate 9 9 Charles Crescent HS22 R30 324 040 2013/10/29 R17 099 946 Accelerate 10 10 Charles Crescent HS22 R19 547 978 2013/10/29 R20 844 885 Accelerate 11 Saveways  R464 159 510 2015/11/05 R700 000 000 Benfield Inv 12 Forum Sasolburg No information No response from Klopper or Georgiou Moneyweb sent questions to Georgiou and Klopper (in his capacities as both business rescue practitioner and director of Orthotouch) on November 9, 2018, relating to the selloff of the properties. Neither responded to the questions. The Section 155 Scheme of Arrangement (SoA), which was implemented three years after the failure of the BRP, offered an explanation. The SoA stated that the properties were not transferred as Orthotouch wasn’t able to acquire funding from financial institutions. This was due to the actions of so-called “detractors”, which “sought to bring about the failure and demise of the HS Companies”. These detractors were never named, but were accused of influencing financial institutions against providing funding to the group. The SoA did, however, highlight that Georgiou went to great lengths to acquire funding from various financial institutions, a process that would have taken several months. The SoA does not, on the other hand, explain why the majority of the identified “primary properties” were sold within a few months. A few of these sales transactions deserve further analysis. Southdale The Southdale Shopping Centre was the flagship property in the HS 17 syndication and was syndicated to investors for R205.5 million. At the time, it was the largest single property ever syndicated by any HS syndication. The BRP also cited the centre as one of the “primary” shopping centres destined to receive additional investment to increase its revenue potential, but this never materialised. The property was sold less than a month after the implementation of the BRP. It was sold via a back-to-back transaction from Orthotouch to Georgiou’s company Zephan, which then on-sold it to Serica Investments. The transaction resulted in a profit of R26 million for HS 17, but a significant loss of R57 million for Orthotouch. Zephan, in turn, earned a profit of R33 million from the transaction.

The Randview Shopping Centre was originally syndicated as part of HS 16 and valued in the BRP for R105 million. The source of the valuations that feature in the BRP was never disclosed. Yet the property was sold in a back-to-back transaction to Orthotouch (R160.9 million) and then immediately to Zephan for R105 million. The transaction did not stop there. Zephan then sold it to Moxicorp straight after for R148 million. Georgiou is currently the only director of Moxicorp.

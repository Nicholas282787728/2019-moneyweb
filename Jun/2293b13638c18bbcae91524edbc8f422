Moody’s Investors Service sees South Africa’s central bank cutting its interest rate to support the economy. The economy of Africa’s most-industrialised country will probably expand 1% this year and 1.5% in 2020, the ratings company said in its emailed global macro outlook document Thursday. While the Monetary Policy Committee decided to maintain the repurchase rate at 6.75% in May, two of the five MPC members favoured a 25 basis-point cut. The bank slashed the nation’s economic-growth forecast to 1% from 1.3% previously. President Cyril Ramaphosa’s new administration, elected last month, faces the challenge of boosting confidence in the economy as it confronts a growing fiscal deficit and escalating debt that are risking South Africa’s final investment-grade credit rating at Moody’s. The economy shrank the most in a decade in the first quarter as mining and manufacturing contracted. Business sentiment remains subdued amid policy uncertainty and the absence of meaningful reforms.

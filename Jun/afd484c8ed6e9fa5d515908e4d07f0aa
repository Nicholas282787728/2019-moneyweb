South Africa’s anti-graft ombudsman denied a report by the Johannesburg-based Sunday Times newspaper that it is investigating fresh money-laundering allegations related to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s campaign to win control of the ruling party. Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane is looking into a complaint by the main opposition Democratic Alliance about a R500 000 ($34 791) donation Ramaphosa’s campaign received from a company that’s been implicated in paying bribes to senior government officials, according to her spokesman Oupa Segalwe. Her office has no knowledge of claims by the Sunday Times that it is looking into payments of R400 million, he said by phone from Johannesburg. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P.

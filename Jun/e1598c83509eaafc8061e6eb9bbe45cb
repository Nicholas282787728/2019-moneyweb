South Africa’s annual inflation quickened in May, with the rate reaching the midpoint of the central bank’s target range as higher food and beverage prices contributed to the increase. Annual consumer-price growth accelerated to 4.5% from a year earlier, compared with 4.4% in April, the Pretoria-based Statistics South Africa said Wednesday in a statement on its website. The median estimate of 17 economists in a Bloomberg survey was 4.4%.  Key insights What Bloomberg’s economist says: The inflation reading was “in line with the Sarb projections. As such, I don’t think it will materially affect the Sarb’s rate trajectory. What will be of higher importance is the Fed’s communication today about potential rate cuts, possibly as soon as next month. Whether deputy governor Daniel Mminele stays on the MPC beyond the end of his mandate at the end of the month will also be key to the ability of Governor Lesetja Kganyago to prioritise bringing down inflation expectations over supporting economic growth.”’ — Mark Bohlund, economist © 2019 Bloomberg L.P.

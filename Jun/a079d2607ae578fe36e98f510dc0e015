RMB, in its role of sole funder and structuring bank, provided a funding package allowing Talis to make an initial equity investment. It also enabled future funding for Talis to meet its capital requirements to facilitate the growth ambitions of Atterbury. Riyaad Khan of RMB talks to Moneyweb editor Ryk van Niekerk about this deal.

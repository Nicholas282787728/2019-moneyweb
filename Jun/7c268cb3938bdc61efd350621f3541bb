A meltdown at some of South Africa’s biggest state companies is intensifying, placing the nation’s finances at risk and frustrating President Cyril Ramaphosa’s efforts to attract new investment and resuscitate a moribund economy. While monolithic power utility Eskom, which is tottering on the brink of insolvency, has dominated recent headlines, arms manufacturer Denel, the South African Broadcasting Corporation and South African Airways have joined the list of the financially destitute entities scrambling for bailouts. The government guarantees most of their debt, so allowing them to go bust isn’t an option, even if it breaks its expenditure ceiling.  Official inquiries have shown that state companies were looted of billions of rand and subjected to constant management upheaval during former President Jacob Zuma’s rule. While Ramaphosa has sought to tackle the graft since succeeding Zuma in February last year and replaced the boards and management of several state companies, their debt has continued to accumulate and National Treasury projections shows the trend continuing until at least March 2021.

The debt burden of the state companies is a risk to South Africa’s last remaining investment-grade credit rating, Moody’s Investors Service said in April. The loss of that rating could trigger a massive outflow of funds from Africa’s largest economy, because it would preclude a number of index-linked funds from retaining their investments. Investors see an increased likelihood that the government will have to increase sovereign-bond issuance to bail out Eskom, which is by far the biggest of the state companies and has amassed more than $30 billion in debt. The yield premium of 2048 securities over 2026 notes widened 50 basis points this month to 181, the most on record.  Eskom funding concern shows in the steepest South Africa yield curve on record

It’s not a popularity contest; you can make a standout chief executive and still face widespread criticism. Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Alphabet’s Larry Page, for example, made the annual list of top 30 CEOs compiled by Barron’s. Some of the leaders with top track records of revenue growth, earnings and shareholder returns are new this year. About a third of the names typically rotate and the rest — think Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett, Jamie Dimon, Larry Fink, Bob Iger and Satya Nadella — come back year after year. Female newcomers include Mary Dillon of Ulta Beauty , praised for leading the cosmetic chain to nearly double the S&P 500’s yearly return since taking over in 2013; Marillyn Hewson of Lockheed Martin for what was termed her savvy direction; and Lisa Su of Advanced Micro Devices for giving Intel a run for its money. More fresh faces making the roster were Bank of America’s Brian Moynihan for turning a loss-maker into the second most profitable bank behind JPMorgan Chase & Co, and Costco Wholesale’s Craig Jelinek for expert merchandising and raising minimum pay for workers. Steve Easterbrook was cited for speeding up drive-through service at McDonald’s while also ramping up same-store sales and the stock price. Stephen Schwarzman, who founded Blackstone Group in 1985, was also new to the list as profits keep piling up for the private equity giant. CEOs to fall off the list this year include: Bernard Arnault of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE
James Gorman of Morgan Stanley
Jensen Huang of Nvidia
Hubert Joly of Best Buy (He became executive chairman in June)
Phebe Novakovic of General Dynamics 
Aditya Puri of HDFC Bank
Robert Sands Constellation Brands (He became executive chair in March)
Frederick Smith of FedEx
Carlos Tavares of Groupe PSA
James Whitehurst of Red Hat (International Business Machines is buying Red Hat)

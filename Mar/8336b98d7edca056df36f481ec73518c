South Africa’s power utility said controlled blackouts will continue through Sunday after a cyclone that hit neighboring Mozambique curbed power imports. “It appears unlikely that the imports from Mozambique will be restored in the next few days,” Eskom said in a statement. The utility planned to build up water reserves for additional power to help the grid avoid further cuts during the week. Stage 4 power cuts, the highest level that has been implemented by the utility, reflects the unreliability of aging coal stations, a reliance on imports and defects in even the newest plants built. That level of electricity rationing will be implemented from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Sunday, according to Eskom. The fourth straight day of rotational power cuts, known as load-shedding, is intended to protect the system from a total collapse.

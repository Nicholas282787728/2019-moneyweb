South Africa’s seasonally adjusted Absa Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell in February, hurt by a decline in business activity due to power cuts and lower new sales orders, a survey showed on Friday. The index, which gauges manufacturing activity in Africa’s most industrialised economy, declined to 46.2 in February from 49.9 in January, remaining below the 50 mark that separates contraction from expansion. “The new sales orders index fell back below the neutral 50-point mark after remaining above that level for the preceding three months. Indications are that both domestic demand and exports weakened during the month,” Absa said in a statement. “The deterioration in overall demand negatively impacted production. The return of load shedding at the start of February likely also weighed on the business activity index.” Power utility Eskom subjected South Africa to the worst power cuts in several years in February due to plant-related problems, diesel shortages and planned maintenance.

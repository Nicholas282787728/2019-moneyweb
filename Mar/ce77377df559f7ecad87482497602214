Here’s what caught our attention on Thursday: 1. MPC interest rate decision The South African Reserve Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) is expected to meet on Thursday to announce its interest rate decision. The benchmark repo rate was kept at 6.75%, following the MPC’s last meeting on January 17, 2019. Economists polled by Reuters forecast that the MPC will keep interest rates on hold on the back of the weakening rand. The decision will be announced at 3:00 pm. 2.

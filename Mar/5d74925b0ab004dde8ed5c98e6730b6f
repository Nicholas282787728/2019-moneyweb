Multinational drugmaker Aspen Pharmacare said it will split its South African Commercial Pharmaceuticals business into two distinct divisions as part of a strategic review of its South African and European operations. Aspen, with a presence in 56 countries spanning six continents, said on Thusday the split would improve its focus on products and customers. In its half-year results statement, it said a second phase of the review would concentrate on developing strategies specific to each division, although it did not say what the two divisions would be.

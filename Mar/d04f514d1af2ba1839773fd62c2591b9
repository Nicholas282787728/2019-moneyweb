Confidence in South Africaâ€™s agricultural industry improved from the worst reading since 2009 in the first quarter but lingered at levels that indicate producers are still downbeat about business conditions. The Agbiz/IDC Agribusiness Confidence Index rose to 46 in the first three months of the year compared with 42 in the prior quarter, the Pretoria-based Agricultural Business Chamber said in an emailed statement Monday. The reading is below the 50 neutral mark. The gauge reflects the perceptions of at least 25 agribusiness decision-makers on subjects including economic growth and export volumes and was conducted from Feb. 28 to March 15.

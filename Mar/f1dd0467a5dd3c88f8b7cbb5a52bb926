An Apple-led tech rally pushed Wall Street higher on Thursday as jitters over the Federal Reserve’s forecast of an economic slowdown were calmed by upbeat economic data. All three major US stock indexes ended the session in the black, with the Nasdaq showing its fifth straight advance, the Dow posting its best day in over a month and the benchmark S&P 500 closing less than 3% below its all-time high set in September. On Wednesday, the Fed surprised investors with a policy statement that was more dovish than expected, as it anticipated no further interest rate hikes this year due to signs of softness in the US economy. But worries about the central bank’s signals on the economy were mollified by upbeat data on Thursday. In separate reports, initial claims for jobless benefits fell more than expected and mid-Atlantic factory activity rebounded sharply. Apple led the tech sector’s advance, rising 3.7% ahead of the company’s expected streaming service debut next week. “Today the market move is (due to) Apple’s weighting in the Dow, the absence of bad news and the market reacting to the Fed’s dovish tone,” said Matthew Keator, managing partner in the Keator Group, a wealth management firm in Lenox, Massachusetts. But Keator would remind investors that the Fed was more hawkish just a few months ago. “The market should maybe be a bit more measured in extrapolating too much from the Fed’s dovish stance because that could change.” Chipmakers also gave technology stocks a lift after Micron Technology predicted a recovery in the memory market as it reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings. Micron’s stock jumped 9.8%. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index rose 3.5%, its biggest percentage gain since late January. The index has surged by nearly 25% so far this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 216.84 points, or 0.84%, to 25 962.51, the S&P 500 gained 30.65 points, or 1.09%, to 2 854.88 and the Nasdaq Composite added 109.99 points, or 1.42%, to 7 838.96. Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, all but financials ended the session in positive territory.

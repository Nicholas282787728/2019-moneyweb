Eskom said on Sunday evening that it is unlikely to implement rolling blackouts this week thanks to an improvement in plant performance. After a nightmare week for businesses and consumers, during which the utility implemented stage-four load shedding, Eskom said the fact that more generation plant is back on line, coupled with replenished diesel and water reserves, means that rolling power cuts probably won’t be necessary in the coming days. The company said that an increase in imports from Mozambique’s Cahora Bassa hydroelectric dam — of 850MW — has also eased the strain on the system. “The risk of load shedding remains as the system continues to be vulnerable,” Eskom said. “But load shedding will only be implemented when absolutely necessary.” (c) 2019 NewsCentral Media This article was published with the permission of TechCentral, the original publication can be viewed here.

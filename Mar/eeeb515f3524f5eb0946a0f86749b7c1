The bad news is that almost half of Americans approaching retirement have nothing saved in a 401(k) or other individual account. The good news is that the new estimate, from the US Government Accountability Office, is slightly better than a few years earlier. Of those 55 and older, 48% had nothing put away in a 401(k)-style defined contribution plan or an individual retirement account, according to a GAO estimate for 2016 that was released Tuesday. That’s an improvement from the 52% without retirement money in 2013. Two in five of such households did have access to a traditional pension, also known as a defined benefit plan. However, 29% of older Americans had neither a pension nor any assets in a 401(k) or IRA account. The estimate from the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, is a brief update to a more comprehensive 2015 report on retirement savings in the US Both are based on the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances. The previous report found the median household, age 65 to 74, had about $148 000 saved, the equivalent of an inflation-protected annuity of $649 a month. “Social Security provides most of the income for about half of households age 65 and older,” the GAO said. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P

South African airline Comair said on Monday it would remove Boeing 737 MAX aircraft from its schedule, after an Ethiopian Airlines passenger jet bound for Nairobi crashed minutes after take-off. The airline, which has ordered eight 737 MAX 8 jets but has only received one so far, said it had decided temporarily not to schedule flights by 737 MAX aircraft while it consults with other operators, Boeing and technical experts.

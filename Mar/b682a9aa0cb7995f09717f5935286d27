Load shedding in South Africa intensified to a maximum scale on Saturday after the state power utility said it lost additional generation, including electricity imports from Mozambique. The power cuts, first implemented over the weekend to replenish water and diesel designed for surplus generation, were raised to so-called Stage 4, removing 4 000 megawatts from the system, Eskom said in a statement on Saturday. It marked a third consecutive day of outages rotated throughout Africa’s most industrialized nation. #POWERALERT 3Date: 16 March 2019 Rotational loadshedding moves to Stage 4 from 12h00, due to loss of additional capacity from Mozambique @TimesLIVE @ewnupdates @eNCA @SABCNewsOnline @CityPowerJhb @City_Ekurhuleni @CityTshwane @CityofCT @eThekwiniM pic.twitter.com/kN9eQRUlpr — Eskom Hld SOC Ltd (@Eskom_SA) March 16, 2019  Eskom’s operational and financial woes stem from years of mismanagement and massive cost overruns on two new coal-fired power stations that should have been completed in 2015. The utility is seen as one of the biggest risks to the country’s economy. The loss of additional capacity included a reduction of electricity imports from neighboring Mozambique. “The situation remains tight and volatile and we may have to implement further load-shedding should the situation deteriorate,” Eskom said. The rotational power cuts, known as load-shedding, are intended to protect the system from a total collapse.

The cuts will be increased from 12 pm.

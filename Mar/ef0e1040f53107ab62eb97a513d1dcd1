The retail price of petrol in South Africa will rise by nearly 9% from April 3, while the price of wholesale diesel will increase by close to 6%, the energy department said on Sunday. The price of petrol will rise by 131 cents to R16.13 per litre in the commercial hub of Gauteng province, while diesel will also go up by 81 cents to R14.87 per litre. In a statement, Minister of Energy Jeff Radabe said the sharp increase in prices was due to higher fuel and road taxes announced in Februaryâ€™s budget.

Here’s what caught our attention on Monday: 1. Stadio results Stadio is reporting an increase in headline earnings per share to 7.8 cents for the year ended December 31, 2018. This is comparable to the 1.2 cents per share reported in the previous period. Core headline earnings per share also increased to 8.6 cents from 0.6 cents previously. Stadio, which invests in private higher education institutions, reported an increase in student numbers from 12 976 to 29 885. The company’s revenue grew to R633 million. No dividend is being declared for the period. 2. RCL Foods results The second half of 2018 proved to be a bad year for food producer RCL Foods, as it saw headline earnings per share decline by 26.4% to 54.8 cents, while headline earnings fell by 26.3% to R475.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2018. The company attributes reduced growth to challenges in the sugar and chicken business units, due to ‘lower prices realised, mainly due to oversupply’. Higher commodity and transport costs also negatively affected margins across the board. A dividend of 15.0 cents per share has been declared. 3.

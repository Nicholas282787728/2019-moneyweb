Maria Ramos has ended her decade as Absa Group (née Barclays Africa) CEO with not much more than a whimper. Given that she left at the end of February, she will not present the group’s 2018 annual results today. Neither, it has been murmured, will interim CEO René van Wyk. Instead, group FD Jason Quinn will. Read: Why doesn’t Absa have a successor to Ramos? Ramos gets deserved credit for implementing Barclays’s strategy following its purchase of Barclays plc’s African operations in 2013. But many remain divided on whether this was the right deal for the bank (at the right price). Corporate and Investment Banking did exceedingly well, but with the Barclays franchise and its associated client-/deal-flow, it would’ve been hard to not do well. Perhaps her biggest achievement was to negotiate the separation from Barclays plc, following its surprise decision to sell down its stake in 2016. Under Ramos, the group’s retail bank in South Africa, in particular, has struggled, losing customers and market share. The purchase of Edcon’s card portfolio for R10 billion in 2012 was nothing short of disastrous for both companies (a situation that is seldom the case). Bank executives in other markets would’ve lost their jobs for a deal like this. Risk appetite The popular narrative holds that Ramos simply couldn’t grow advances (and earnings) under Barclays as it had a lower risk appetite than the bank might’ve had without a UK parent. A comparison with Standard Bank Group over the eight full reporting periods since Ramos took over at Absa Group (March 2009, excluding 2018 as Absa’s results will only be released today) is telling. The two groups are more comparable than, say Nedbank and FirstRand, because they are fairly well diversified in the local market (they both have sizeable corporate and investment bank units) and both have sprawling African operations.

Absa Group, however, kept up on dividends, with CAGR of 11.6%, a tad higher than Standard Bank’s 11.3%. Add in a special dividend of 708c in 2013, and Barclays plc as major shareholder received a handsome flow over the decade that it owned the bank. Advances growth in the retail bank tell the real story. While Standard Bank South Africa only discloses segmental information for the personal and business banking segment, Absa Group publishes numbers for its South African retail banking division separately. ‘Pedestrian’ growth would be an understatement Between December 2009 and December 2017, Absa grew total advances in its local retail bank by just 13.7%. It is unlikely that number has moved dramatically in 2018. A decade ago, total advances in the segment stood at R337.25 billion. Fast-forward to end-2017, and the number was R383.5 billion. To describe the CAGR of 1.62% over the eight years as ‘pedestrian’ would be charitable. Standard Bank, by comparison, grew advances in retail (and business banking) by 55.8% in the same period! Its book grew from R344.24 billion to R536.49 billion. Its compound annual growth rate in an economy that stuttered along for most of those eight years was 5.7% – three-and-a-half times higher than Absa’s. The question that will never have an answer is to what extent Barclays restricted lending. Or was this constrained environment a self-created one because of severe problems in the retail bank, particularly in the core transactional (primary banking) business? You cannot lose millions of customers – especially many of your best customers – across a number of years (which Absa did, but stubbornly refuses to disclose), and still hope to grow your book! Source: Author Headline earnings in the two retail banks grew at a very similar rate (±18% CAGR) over the period. At least Absa managed to grow earnings despite a barely growing lending book. Expenses across the bank remained stubbornly high and there didn’t seem to be any attempt at addressing the structural issues. Read: Absa sees revenue growth overtaking costs in 2019 Where it is far more difficult to judge Ramos is on the ‘softer’ metrics. She battled to fix a culture that desperately needed changing. These efforts had mixed results across her 10 years at the bank. It has lost a lot of excellent senior talent in recent years, including David Hodnett and Phakamani Hadebe, and an overdue reorganisation (as well as changes in the retail bank) saw a number of other departures. In truth, there was no ‘big bold’ strategy because most of her time was spent implementing Barclays’s template and then unimplementing it. It is perhaps ironic that Ramos won’t be around to see the ‘new’ Absa under what is essentially her strategy. How different it all might’ve been, were it not for Barclays.

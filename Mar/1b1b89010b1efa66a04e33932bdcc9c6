Safaricom, Kenya’s biggest mobile operator, agreed a partnership with a unit of Alibaba that will facilitate electronic payments. The deal extends Safaricom customers’ ability to use its mobile-money service, known as M-Pesa, outside Kenya as the company looks to establish the system as a global platform. The firm has existing agreements with payments companies Western Union and Paypal. The partnership allows shoppers on AliExpress, Alibaba’s online retail service, to pay for purchases using M-Pesa. It targets micro-traders in Kenya who source goods and other supplies from China, the Nairobi-based company said in a statement Tuesday. The partnership “marks yet another important milestone not just in Safaricom’s efforts to take M-Pesa beyond Kenya, but to Kenya’s participation in the international e-commerce marketplace,” Chief Financial Services Officer Sitoyo Lopokoiyit said in the statement. Mobile money accounts for 30% of Safaricom’s revenue and is forecast to grow 14% in the coming financial year. About 46% of international e-commerce transactions in Kenya are on AliExpress, Chief Customer Officer Sylvia Mulinge said at a briefing.

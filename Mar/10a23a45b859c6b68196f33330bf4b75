Uber Technologies is set to offer over $3 billion to buy Dubai-based rival Careem Networks FZ, two sources familiar with the deal told Reuters. Uber’s offer could be unveiled during the early part of this week, a third source added. Uber will pay $1.4 billion in cash and $1.7 billion in convertible notes, which will be convertible into Uber shares at a price equal to $55 per share, Bloomberg had earlier reported, citing a term-sheet. Careem declined comment while Uber did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters to comment. Uber has been preparing for an initial public offering, and its bankers have indicated that it could be valued at as much as $120 billion.

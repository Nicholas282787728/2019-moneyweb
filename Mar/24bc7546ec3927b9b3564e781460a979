South African inflation was in line with forecasts in February at 4.1% annually and 0.8% month-on-month as food prices remained steady, supporting expectations the central bank will keep interest rates unchanged. Price growth has trended below the mid-point of the Reserve Bank’s target of between 3% and 6% for three months in a row, prompting calls for a cut in lending rates to support flagging economic growth.

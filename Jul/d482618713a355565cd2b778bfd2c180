Emerging-market shares rose on Thursday amid optimism over trade, while developing-world currencies tread water ahead of the Turkish central bank meeting, where officials are expected to deliver one of the biggest rate cuts in the country’s history. A Reuters poll forecast the Turkish central bank would cut a key rate by 250 basis points, and several analysts have priced predicted a cut of as much as 300 bps. The rate decision is considered pivotal. The central bank has a new governor, Mural Uysal, who was named after President Tayyip Erdogan sacked his predecessor, Murat Cetinkaya. Reuters reported last week that Cetinkaya was fired after he rebuffed requests for a 300-bps cut on June 12. The rate decision will be announced at 1100 GMT. “We find it difficult to make a forecast with conviction, given the political pressure on the bank and lack of clarity on how much emphasis the bank will give to the base-effects-driven decline in inflation,” said analysts from Credit Suisse in a note. The lira was slightly lower and stocks in Istanbul rose 0.2%.

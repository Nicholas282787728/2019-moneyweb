A Zimbabwean lawyer backed by a prominent legal group has challenged the government’s decision to revert to the Zimbabwe dollar and outlaw the use of US, South African and European currencies. Supported by the Harare-based Lawyers for Human Rights group, lawyer Godfrey Mupanga filed a petition against the decision on constitutional grounds. The June 24 decree by finance minister Mthuli Ncube is illegitimate because such decisions should be ratified by lawmakers, he argues, according to court documents viewed by Bloomberg.

Ncube had repeatedly told Zimbabweans that he wouldn’t revert to the Zimbabwe dollar as the country’s sole currency until “fundamentals” were in place, including low and stable inflation and foreign currency reserves to protect it. Zimbabwe’s inflation rate was 98% in May.

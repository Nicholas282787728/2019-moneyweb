Jumia Technologies’s plan to expand its online retail and trading platform in less developed parts of Africa has long had one significant challenge: A lack of formal addresses for deliveries. That may be about to change due to an agreement with Vivo Energy, the London-listed owner of more than 2 100 Shell and Engen-branded service stations across the continent. Under the terms of the deal, the sites will be used as pick-up points for Jumia-bought goods and customers will be able to pay for them at the same time as buying gas.

Operating in Nigeria and 13 other African markets, the Berlin-based company has to overcome challenges such as a lack of internet penetration, mapping and customers without bank accounts. For Vivo, the deal brings an opportunity to further expand its fast-growing non-fuels business. Both companies have sold shares in international markets over the past 18 months. Jumia has gained 35% since an initial public offering in New York in April and is worth $1.5 billion, while Vivo listed in London a year earlier and is worth about $1.9 billion. Their partnership will initially be rolled out in Kenya, Morocco, Senegal and Ivory Coast. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P.

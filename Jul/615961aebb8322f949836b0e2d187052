Liberty Holdings said on Thursday half-year earnings are expected to jump at least 45% as the firm proceeds with its turnaround plan. Normalised headline earnings per share, a key profit measure that excludes certain one-off items, is expected to be between 698.9 cents and 747.1 cents per share for the six months ended June 30, up from 482 cents a year earlier. “Progress is being made towards rebuilding a competitive and sustainable business, resulting in improved operating earnings whilst the focus on new business volumes continues,” the firm said in a statement. Liberty Holdings’ interim results will be released on August 1.

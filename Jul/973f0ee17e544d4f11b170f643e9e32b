South Africa recorded a R4.42 billion ($310.61 million) trade surplus in June after a revised R1.70 billion surplus in May, data from the revenue service showed on Wednesday. Exports fell 3.2% on a month-on-month basis to R108.17 billion in June, while imports were down 5.8% to R103.75 billion, the South African Revenue Service said. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says the data temporarily washes a sense of optimism over the SA economy. “However, both exports and imports declined in June with the 5.8% drop in imports caused by weak domestic growth. With exports dropping by 3.2% month-over-month amid slowing global growth, this is negative for South Africa, especially when factoring how exports account for approximately 30% of GDP.” The rand showed muted reaction to the release of the figures, which suggests, according to Otunuga, that the local currency is more concerned with external drivers. The US Federal Reserve will announce its latest decision interest rates on Wednesday and Otunuga says the rand, like many other emerging market currencies, “could remain on standby until the rate decision and Jerome Powell’s post-meeting press conference”.

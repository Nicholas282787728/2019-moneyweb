What happened to the locally listed South African tech sector? Just a few years back it was one of the hottest sectors on the JSE, with large companies like EOH, BCX and Altron being staples in many portfolios. These businesses were attractive, as they had thick margins and lucrative large contracts. But then things changed. Several of the largest players were undone by projects that went horribly wrong, as well as risky shareholding structures that ended up devaluing these companies. The disappearance of BCX also reduced the weighting of the technology index, when it was bought out by Telkom in 2015.

Now it’s very different. The technology index has fallen to 30 859 points and is trading 41% below the Top 40 index’s 52 199 points. The initial fall in the technology index came soon after the troubles at Altron, one of the largest tech companies in the county, came to light. An ill-fated venture into East Africa saw it writing off millions. Its problems saw revenue fall 8% to R10.5 billion and it incurred a R447 million post-tax loss in its half-year results to end-August 2015.

It saw revenue rise 30% to R19.1 billion and net profit surge 46% to R680 million for the year to end-February 2019. But even its recent performance was not enough to offset the fall in the technology index. Although its share price recovered, to around R26, which is way up from its low of R4.50 in November 2015, it could not counteract the fall of another local tech heavyweight, EOH. From a high of close to R180 in August 2015, EOH has since collapsed to the just under R20 it is trading at now. The collapse in its valuation was first triggered by some of its directors being on the wrong side of a derivatives position, and was later driven down by allegations that it was involved in state capture.

EOH first denied any wrongdoing, saying aside from these businesses, it found no evidence of corruption on its part, despite numerous internal and external investigations. But when Microsoft SA announced in February that it would no longer have EOH act as a reseller of its software licences, its share price collapsed again. The global tech giant took these steps after someone laid a complaint with the US Securities and Exchange Commission regarding alleged corruption in a department of defence software deal. Newly-appointed CEO Stephen van Coller said he would get to the bottom of these allegations. A report on its investigation into the matter will be released next week.

Although the sector has yet to regain its lustre, it should be seen against a background were the valuations of technology companies have a habit shooting up like a firecracker and then exploding once serious issues are discovered. It’s a pattern that has repeated its self over the decades. Dimension Data is one such company. Its rapidly rising share price saw it briefly become SA’s largest listed company with a market capitalisation of R77.3 billion, and was even in the top 50 companies on London’s FTSE 100 Index in 2000. It all came crashing down when the dot-com bubble burst in 2001 and it lost 40% of its value in the first week of July. Over the following decade, it went onto make a marvellous recovery. It eventually sold for R24.4 billion to NTT of Japan in 2010. Read: There was a similar story with the rise and fall of Gijima. Its share price rocketed up in the late 2010s, but it could not shake allegations of wrongdoing regarding a lucrative government contract. Little has been heard of it since shareholders accepted chairman Robert Gumede’s offer of R2.20 per share, resulting in it being delisted in May 2015. The price it was bought out for was a far cry from when it was trading at R50 a share in April 2010. Another reason the tech sector has gone off the boil is that in many ways it is a function of which way the economy goes. When things are going well, big tech companies want to scale up. They do this by buying out smaller players and by paying them in shares. The problem is that the shares are often overvalued and the owners of these businesses prohibited from selling them for a few years. By the time these shares vest, the share price has slumped, and they are poorer for it. In the same way, a strong economy boosts the tech sector, a weak economy drags it down, as companies are hesitant to spend on big tech projects. Etion, for example, had some of its clients hold off on launching these IT projects. “Clients are postponing contracts after signing”, says Etion CEO Teddy Daka.

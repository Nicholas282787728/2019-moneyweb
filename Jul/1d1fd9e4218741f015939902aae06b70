Higher temperatures across the globe could expose almost a billion more people to risks for diseases like Zika and Ebola by 2080 and that may be a boon for some drugmakers, Morgan Stanley tells investors. Climate change could spell the rapid spread of infectious diseases and Europe in particular is at risk, analysts led by health-care specialist Matthew Harrison wrote in a note to clients. The $500 billion infectious disease market could see demand for an added $125 billion in new vaccines, or as much as $200 billion assuming premium pricing for more complex new treatments, Morgan Stanley estimates. Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline and Merck are among the best-positioned vaccine makers with resources already setup for large-scale production, the bank said. Other players like Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Takeda Pharmaceutical and Moderna could also play a role. Pfizer, one of the largest vaccine makers globally, hasn’t disclosed any recent research into tropical diseases but has significant development capabilities, Morgan Stanley said. While Moderna’s efforts to develop a cancer vaccine are more closely followed by Wall Street, the mid-cap company also has a Zika vaccine and a treatment for chikungunya in development. Morgan Stanley is not the only bank looking at investment opportunities from climate change, on Wednesday Goldman Sachs said it was hiring a sustainable-finance group that is looking into issues related to sustainability. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P.

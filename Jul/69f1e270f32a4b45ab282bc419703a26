Heineken shares fell the most in almost four years after the world’s second-largest brewer reported earnings growth that almost ground to a halt, held back by costs for aluminium cans and poor weather in Europe. Adjusted operating profit rose 0.3% on an organic basis, the slowest pace for the first half in at least six years, the company reported Monday. The stock fell as much as 6.5% in Amsterdam. Even though revenue growth beat estimates, Heineken is having a hard time translating that into profit due to higher costs, mostly tied to packaging. About half of that was currency-related due to the slump in the Brazilian real against the dollar, according to chief financial officer Laurence Debroux. Still, Heineken kept its forecast for mid-single-digit percentage growth in operating profit this year. “This does not leave room for error,” wrote Olivier Nicolai, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. Heineken will need to accelerate to growth of 10% in the second half against a difficult comparison, he said. The majority of higher input costs are hedged and should ease in the second half and into 2020, Debroux said. The company’s other reasons for the profit slowdown were investments in e-commerce, technology upgrades and the phasing of expenses. Heineken also said it expects a 100 million-euro boost to operating profit from favourable currency shifts this year. Poor weather in Europe has been a theme for major consumer-goods companies reporting this quarter including Unilever and Danone. Investors have yet to see if Europe’s record temperatures in July will boost demand in the third quarter. Until now brewers have only reported negative impacts from the weather this year. Volume growth slowed in the second quarter, partly due to tough comparisons with the year-earlier period, which benefited from the World Cup soccer tournament. Shipments of the brewer’s namesake brand fell in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe in the second quarter. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P.

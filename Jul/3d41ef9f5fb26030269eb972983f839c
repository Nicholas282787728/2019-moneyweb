South Africa’s rand edged higher against the dollar in early Friday trade and bond yields fell after the central bank cut its main lending rate by 25 basis points on Thursday in a widely expected move to counter floundering economic growth. At 0730 GMT the rand was 0.13% firmer at 13.82 per dollar, after closing at 13.84 in the previous session. The South African Reserve Bank (Sarb) cut rates by 25 basis points to 6.5% in a unanimous decision, its first easing since March 2018, although it struck a cautious tone suggesting future reductions to borrowing costs were not a foregone conclusion despite benign inflation.

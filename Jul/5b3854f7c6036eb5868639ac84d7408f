Jabu Mabuza, chairman of the South African power utility regarded as the biggest risk to the nation’s economy, has taken on a non-executive director role at pay-TV company, MultiChoice Group. The announcement adds to an impressive list of Mabuza’s board positions. He is also chairman of the Anheuser-Busch InBev’s Africa board, Sun International and the Casino Association of South Africa. He did recently give up the chairmanship at Telkom, though. The latest move comes at a time when the state-owned electricity giant, Eskom, is looking for a new chief executive officer, is seeking a multi-billion dollar bailout from the government and plans to split into three units. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P.

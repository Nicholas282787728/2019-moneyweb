In any other week, the prospect of a major emerging-market central bank cutting interest rates to an unprecedented low would dominate the agenda. But the likelihood that Brazil will reduce its target rate to a record this week is merely a sub-plot in the story of falling global borrowing costs highlighted by the Federal Reserve’s much-anticipated decision Wednesday, when US policy makers may not only cut their key rate for the first time in more than a decade, but also give clues to what’s in store for the rest of the year. While the meeting may determine the fate of many developing economies for the coming months, much may also depend on the outcome of fresh talks between the US and China, as investors continue to assess the impact of the year-long trade war. Though emerging-market dollar bonds have advanced since May on the expectation that the Fed will cut rates, the premium they offer is still wider than in early 2018 and most of 2017. Policy makers will need to “to walk a fine line to keep the Goldilocks scenario going,” according to Abdul Kadir Hussain, the head of fixed-income asset management at Dubai-based Arqaam Capital. “If the Fed is too downbeat on growth, US Treasuries will rally, but spreads might sell off. But if they are hawkish at all, Treasuries will sell and spreads will widen too. Chances are the Fed will deliver for now, and the rally keep going” for the next few months.

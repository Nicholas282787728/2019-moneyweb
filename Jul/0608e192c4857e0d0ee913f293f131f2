Power Treasurer, Andre Pillay, has tendered his resignation and will leave at the end of August 2019. Pillay’s departure follows that of CEO Phakamani Hadebe in late May, after only a year in the job. Pillay’s puts further pressure on the power utility, which earlier this year asked for billions of rands in support from the state, to fund its operations.

He was subsequently promoted to General Manager (Group Treasurer) in September 2016. “We are cognisant of how critical the group treasurer role is for Eskom and have requested that Pillay remain in the position for the next two months to ensure a seamless transition and business continuity through the handover process. Andre’s replacement will be announced in due course. We believe that Treasury operations will continue with ease with the support of the current Treasury leadership,” said Calib Cassim, Eskom’s chief financial officer.

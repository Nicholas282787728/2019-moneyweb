In South Africa, solar and wind are in, and coal is gradually on the way out. That’s the key takeaway from the latest Integrated Resource Plan, which maps out the energy mix for the next decade. It envisions the nation’s electricity production capacity rising significantly by 2030, with the bulk of the increase coming from renewable sources. pic.twitter.com/6S7twetpom — Department of Energy (@Energy_ZA) October 18, 2019  A switch to more green energy comes as South Africa faces pressure to meet emissions-reduction targets. State power utility Eskom produces about 95% of the nation’s power, the bulk of it from coal-fired power plants — many of which are approaching retirement date and don’t comply with environmental standards. My reading of our new power plan: apart from already committed coal plants, most new generation will come from solar and wind. And lots of old coal plants will be decommissioned. pic.twitter.com/DRz5CYnsqV — Michael Jordaan (@MichaelJordaan) October 18, 2019  A first version of the resource plan was adopted in 2011. While the government said it would be regularly updated and published several drafts, they were never approved. The latest iteration of the blueprint was released by Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe in the capital, Pretoria, on Friday. It envisions an additional 14 400 megawatts of power being produced from wind, 6 000 megawatts from photovoltaic solar plants, 3 000 megawatts from gas, 2 500 megawatts from hydropower and 1 500 megawatts from coal by 2030, Mantashe said.

Additional nuclear capacity will be installed at a pace and scale the country can afford, while investment will be made in more efficient coal technology, Mantashe said. Coal will continue to play a significant role in electricity generation, accounting for 59% of output, while nuclear will contribute 5%, hydropower 8%, photovoltaic solar 6%, wind 18% and gas and storage 2%. While the coal’s installed capacity will be lower than current installed base, it will remain the dominant energy supply contributing 59% of the energy volumes required to meet demand. Nuclear will contribute 5%; Hydro 8%; Photovoltaic 6%; Wind: 18%; Gas & Storage 2%. #IRP2019 — Gwede Mantashe (@GwedeMantashe1) October 18, 2019  Eskom, which has amassed R450 billion in debt and is reliant on government bailouts to remain solvent, has instituted rotating blackouts since Wednesday after a series of breakdowns at its plants. The energy blueprint doesn’t discuss how the utility can be fixed — that will be addressed in separate plans that the government intends releasing by the end of the month. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P.

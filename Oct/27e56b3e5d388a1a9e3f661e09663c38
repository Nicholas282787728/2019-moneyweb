Russia will on Wednesday land the world’s biggest military aircraft in South Africa, the Tupolev Tu-160 ‘Blackjack’ bomber, in a rare display of cooperation between the defence forces of the two countries. The two bombers, which are capable of launching nuclear missiles, are the first to ever land in Africa and will be escorted by fighter jets from the South African Air Force when they touch down at the Waterkloof air base in Tshwane, the South African National Defence Force said in a statement. The bombers will arrive at 06:30 and a number of other Russian military aircraft will also land at the site. “The military-to-military relations between the two countries are not solely built on struggle politics but rather on fostering mutually beneficial partnerships based on common interests,” the SANDF said. Russia’s defence ministry put out a similar statement. Notice to aircraft spotters in South Africa: You're going to get the rare chance to see two Tu-160s, an Il-62, and an An-124 arriving in Tshwane, as part of an historic visit by the Russian Air Force to the South African Air Force. Interesting diplomatic move by Russia too. pic.twitter.com/ZJsBqYenKN — Darren Olivier (@darren_olivier) October 21, 2019  The arrival of the bombers in Africa’s most industrialised nation coincides with Russian President Vladimir Putin hosting an Africa summit this week, the first such event to be organised by Russia. The nation is competing with China and the US for influence in Africa. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P.

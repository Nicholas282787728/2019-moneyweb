The image of Africa’s biggest fund manager has been damaged by allegations of misconduct and breaches of corporate governance and the institution must now strive to preserve what’s left of its reputation, its interim chairman Reuel Khoza said. The Public Investment Corporation, which oversees R2.13 trillion ($139 billion) of mainly South African government worker pensions, has been the subject of a commission of inquiry. That’s involved months of public testimony into allegations of political interference and questionable investment decisions. Key insights “These interventions and prolonged negative publicity have impacted on the image, performance and staff morale of the PIC,” said Khoza, who was appointed as interim chairman in July as the government broke with the tradition of naming the deputy finance minister to the post. The board is an interim one as the commission is scheduled to make recommendations on how the money manager is run, by the end of this month. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P.

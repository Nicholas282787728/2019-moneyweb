A number of other Russian military aircraft will also land at the site. “The military-to-military relations between the two countries are not solely built on struggle politics but rather on fostering mutually beneficial partnerships based on common interests,” the SANDF said. Russia’s defense ministry put out a similar statement. Notice to aircraft spotters in South Africa: You're going to get the rare chance to see two Tu-160s, an Il-62, and an An-124 arriving in Tshwane, as part of an historic visit by the Russian Air Force to the South African Air Force.

Armscor’s financial statements for the year to March 31, received an unqualified audit report with findings from the Auditor-General (AG). The findings, shown below, in my view indicate that the oversight that should be exercised by the board is slipping: Property, plant and equipment Acquisitions included R11.8 billion for the Department of Defence (DoD), of which R7.4 billion related to technology and capital acquisition projects, and R4.3 billion to maintenance and support contracts. The property, plant and equipment valuation of R1.9 billion (2018 – R1.5 billion) includes land and buildings of R1.8 billion (2018 – R1.3 billion). Yet the revaluation reserve, which is included in the land and buildings closing balance, sits at R1.8 billion (2018 – R1.4 billion). Certain buildings are on leasehold land, while others are on land owned by the state. The Institute for Maritime Technology building is erected on land leased from the Department of Public Works, and the Paardefontein Antenna Test Range building is erected on land owned by the state. One would assume that the leasehold premises and the premises located on state land were not revalued in the books of Armscor, as they do not have titles to the land. Then again … The Alkantpan water pipeline runs through farms on which there is a servitude. Armscor describes the facility thus: “Alkantpan Test Range, located in the central semi-desert part of South Africa, is a strategic ISO 9001 all-purpose ballistic test range for medium to large calibre weapons and ammunition. Various related tests are also catered for, like Insensitive Munitions, Hazard Classification, Ageing, Surveillance Trails, etc.” This land is regularly blown up, at a cost. Costs incurred for rehabilitating the site were R1.8 million (2018 – R2.3 million). Residential properties held by Armscor Research and Development will be sold to “potential buyers”, “with the lessees having the first option to buy”. With the worrying comment from the AG that senior management “did not exercise sufficient oversight responsibility over financial and performance reporting”, I would suggest that the above incestuous property arrangements leave much room for abuse. Financial position Employee-related costs of R1.1 billion (2018 – R1.1 billion) are almost double the revenue of R648.6 million (2018 – R612.7 million). Armscor would not survive without the government grant of R1.1 billion (2018 – R1.1 billion). Government grants for the last five years total R4.8 billion. The surplus for the year is R235.3 million (2018 – deficit of R10.1 million). Irregular expenditure amounted to R22.2 million (2018 – R18.5 million). What is notable is that the R18.5 million brought forward from 2018 was not condoned in 2019. Why not? Does it perhaps involve corruption, or is there perhaps a lack of “full and proper records?” Armscor does not name the “significant debtor” that is tardy in making payments. In 2019 an amount of R124.6 million was impaired (2018 – R39.9 million). In 2019 a previous year’s impairment of R204.1 million (2018 – R13 000) was reversed as the tardy debtor paid up. Executive remuneration Armscor carries significant costs in regard to executives: chief financial officer Gerhard Grobler earned R3.3 million (2018 – R3 million), former CEO Kevin Wakeford, who left in February, earned R4.5 million (2018 – R4.2 million) and acting CEO advocate Solomzi Mbada earned R3.2 million. Non-executive directors earned R6.2 million (2018 – R4.7 million), and executive committee members earned R19 million (2018 – 17.3 million). For an organisation that depends on government grants, this is not sustainable. Further, a government that is demanding more and more from a diminishing pool of taxpayers, to fund its wasteful grants, should start cutting costs where it can. Board chair and former ambassador to France Thuthukile Skweyiya claims that Armscor is an important nexus between the defence force and the defence industry. She does however note that these are challenging times, and offers a rousing battle cry: “We may not have reached the bottom of our challenges in the defence sector. But we are certain that even when we plummet further, we’ll be ready to rise again as mist clears and our path becomes more defined.” Not sure if I should reach for tissues or popcorn … Armscor should surely be on the list of state-owned entities to be restructured.

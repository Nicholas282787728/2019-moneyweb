In light of these changes, the Government Employees Medical Scheme (Gems) explored the significant ways the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) will impact the healthcare industry at its 2019 symposium held recently in Durban. The second component of the two-day conference focused on the future of South Africa’s healthcare environment – particularly with the approaching implementation of the National Health Insurance fund, which aims to make quality healthcare services accessible to all. Moneyweb spoke to Gems chief operations officer Dr Stan Moloabi about these innovations and how they will enable the scheme to contribute towards creating an enabling environment for universal healthcare.

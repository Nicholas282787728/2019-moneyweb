Businesses also have a presence on these platforms, which gives them an opportunity not only to foster better relations with their customers but also to mine data on how to give them better value. This cannot be done if businesses do not take the time to understand these platforms and investigate which ones are better to drive their customer communication strategies. Impact Amplifier associate impact accelerator Vuyolwethu Dubese spoke to Moneyweb at the 2019 Government Employees Medical Scheme (Gems) Symposium about how businesses can employ the data consumers share to unlock growth opportunities, or ignore it at their peril.

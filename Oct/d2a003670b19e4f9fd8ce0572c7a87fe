Trade war-hardened emerging-market investors aren’t counting on any breakthrough in trade negotiations as talks between the US and China are set to resume Thursday in Washington. BNP Paribas Asset Management has been reducing its exposure in junk-rated debt, while Union Investments Privatfonds GmbH is favouring investment-grade rated bonds over high-yield debt. And in case any breakdown in discussions triggers a flight to safety, Aviva Investors has been buying the yen. “We expect another empty-handshake meeting,” said Bryan Carter, London-based head of emerging-market fixed-income at BNP Paribas Asset. Ultimately, no substantive agreement will be reached, he said.  Emerging-market stocks have rebounded as much as 5.8% from early September, when China and the US announced they would hold face-to-face negotiations once again. The rally has since petered out after President Donald Trump said he won’t seek an interim agreement and global growth showed further signs of deterioration as the year-long trade war dragged on. Impeachment proceedings have also spurred concern that it may hinder Trump’s hand in the negotiations.

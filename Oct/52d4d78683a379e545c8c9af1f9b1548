A Special Appropriation Bill was recently tabled in Parliament to provide Eskom with much-needed finance over the next two years. If approved, it will see the troubled utility get R26 billion in the 2019/20 financial year and R33 Billion in the following. This is not, however, a blank cheque. National Treasury, in consultation with the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) have released these conditions, which are not only onerous, but some may be near-on impossible to implement. Eskom’s responsibilities DPE’s responsibilities Treasury shoots own goal In its eagerness to get the ball rolling on fixing Eskom, National Treasury has shot too far, and has lost sight of the ball. Producing monthly management accounts compliant with IFRS is, quite frankly, nonsensical.  Management accounts are drawn up on a different basis to IFRS financial statements, and IFRS adjustments are made annually (for example, mark to market, capitalised interest, etc.) An IFRS statement of profit and loss does not contain the details that management would require. Why not do as other CEO/CFOs do, and study the cash flow statement and schedule of loan commitments on a monthly basis, and study the management accounts on a quarterly basis? Oh, wait … Eskom’s financial woes are not due to inadequate financial management. To name just a few problems: state capture, bloated inefficient labour force, procurement problems, coal transport, quality of coal, coal contracts, badly maintained plant, and all sorts of problems in completing Medupi and Kusile. Introducing some cash management and financial planning into Eskom is ideal, but overkill is not.

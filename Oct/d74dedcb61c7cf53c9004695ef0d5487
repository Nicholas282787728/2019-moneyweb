The rand was stable in early trade on Friday as investors awaited direction from US non-farm payrolls data out later in the day. At 0615 GMT, the rand was 0.05% firmer at 15.15 per dollar versus a close of 15.16 on Thursday. Investors have been caught out by a set of weak US data this week, including surveys on services and manufacturing sectors, deepening fears the Sino-US trade war is starting to hurt growth in the world’s biggest economy. Lower US interest rate expectations lift investors’ appetite for emerging markets assets, which offer higher returns but carry more risk. The South African currency is expected to trade in the range of between R15.05 per dollar to R15.20 per dollar, NKC African Economics said in a morning note. Bonds were a touch weaker, with the yield on the benchmark government issue due in 2026 up 0.5 basis point to 8.25%.

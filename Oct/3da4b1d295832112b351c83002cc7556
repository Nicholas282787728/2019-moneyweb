China is seeking $2.4 billion in trade countermeasures against the US in a seven-year-old case it lodged with the World Trade Organisation. In a document published on the WTO’s website on Monday, China requested that the Geneva-based trade arbiter discuss the matter at its next meeting of its dispute settlement body on October 28. “In response to the United States’ continued non-compliance’’ with the WTO’s rulings, China requests authorisation “to suspend concessions and related obligations at an annual amount of $2.4 billion,’’ according to the filing. At issues in the dispute are countervailing measures imposed by the US that affected items including thermal paper, pressure pipe and kitchen shelving. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P.

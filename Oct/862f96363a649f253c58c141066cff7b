Denel continued to struggle under the weight of liquidity problems, difficulty paying creditors, and a lack of skills and proper accounting systems according to the financial year ended March 2019. To exacerbate its woes, state capture has left a climate of fear and mistrust in the organisation. The Auditor-General (AG) was unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for an opinion on the annual financial statements, and hence issued a disclaimer of opinion. This essentially makes all the figures reflected in the annual report suspect. Lack of internal control and accounting records Accounting standards specified by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International Accounting Standards (IAS) were not properly applied as, in addition to technical knowledge, these require effective internal controls, proper accounting records, and appropriate audit evidence. A sample of the most critical transgressions are disclosed below: Key financial figures In a nutshell – revenue dropped to R3.8 billion (2018: R5.8 billion), cash dropped to R540 million (R1.3 billion), and borrowings are R3.4 billion (2018: R3.3 billion). Irregular expenditure (inadequate records) amounted to R2.1 million (2018: R1.9 million) and fruitless and wasteful expenditure came to R136 million (2018: nil). Material uncertainty relating to going concern status The group suffered a net loss of R1.7 billion (2018: net loss of R1 billion), increasing the retained loss to R7.8 billion (2018: R5.6 billion). The group suffered a net cash outflow of R1.2 billion from operating activities, and had difficulty in paying its overdue core creditors. On the bright side: Constructive action The board of directors, appointed in May 2018, is confident that Denel “has core products, basic systems and skills which form the critical and required base for an effective business turnaround”. I’ve heard that song before.

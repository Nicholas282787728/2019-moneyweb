President Cyril Ramaphosa said far-reaching reforms will be needed to achieve the R1.2 trillion of investment his government wants to attract over five years. “To attract investment we need to make it easier to do business in South Africa,” Ramaphosa said in a weekly statement posted on his Twitter account. He’ll deliver the opening address at an investment conference in London later on Monday. South Africa’s ranking in the World Economic Forum’s 2019 Global Competitiveness Report improved seven places to 60th position. Further government measures are planned to improve the nation’s competitiveness, Ramaphosa said. In everything that we do to grow our economy, our main aim must be to improve the lives of South Africans. We want to build an inclusive economy that has a real impact on the quality of life of poor and working-class people. https://t.co/MC4E05pwhV pic.twitter.com/GRcToSviCl — Cyril Ramaphosa  © 2019 Bloomberg L.P.

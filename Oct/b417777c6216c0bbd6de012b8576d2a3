Executives at Woolworths Holdings have largely not been paid short-term incentives for the third year running. Only a single executive – Zyda Rylands, CEO of Woolworths South Africa – was paid a short-term incentive bonus for the year ended June 30, 2019. Rylands received a bonus of R2.1 million for the turnaround in the Woolworths South Africa business. However, despite the performance multiplier of the SA unit triggering a bonus of 50% of her guaranteed pay of R8.9 million, the remuneration committee agreed to reduce the group’s short-term incentive bonus pool by 50% “to align with budgeted growth expectations”. Read: Woolworths sees annual profit hit, writes down Australian business After the sharp cuts to the bonus pool, management in South Africa shared short-term incentives equivalent to 1.55% of group adjusted profit before tax (aPBT) of R4.062 billion (R63 million), while store staff shared 1.18% (R48 million) and its supply chain staff shared a pool of 0.20% of aPBT (R8 million). The group says its bonus pool for this year (2020) has been reduced by 50% in Woolworths South Africa, 50% in Country Road Group and 65% in David Jones. “This has been done to align the bonus pools with the initial budgeted growth expectations of the operating entities. The committee may review the bonus pools during the year depending on trading performance achieved in each of the operating entities.” Lean times for executives With the exception of Rylands, the last time CEO Ian Moir or any other executive director received a short-term incentive payment was 2016. In that year, Moir was paid a short-term incentive bonus of R14.96 million with guaranteed pay of R16.6 million.

The Woolies board has requested that Moir spend more time in Australia until the department store business is turned around. He has 1.8 million unvested shares under the group’s long-term incentive scheme, with a fair value figure of R35 million. For these to vest, performance across headline earnings per share growth, return on capital employed and total shareholder return will be measured. Given its size, these are (effectively) directly linked to David Jones’s performance. Market cap down Over the last four years (since executives last received short-term incentives), the group’s market capitalisation has reduced by R36 billion to R51 billion as at 30 June. In FY2019, the group missed the long-term incentive trigger of greater than 93% of adjusted profit before tax by just 10 basis points; it achieved 92.9% of profit before tax, “adjusted for impairment of David Jones assets, relocation costs (net of grants received) and store exit costs, net onerous lease provisions raised and unrealised foreign exchange losses incurred/reversed”. Still, executives received their annual rolling allocations of long-term incentives under a plan revised in 2019. Moir received restricted share plan (RSP) awards with a face value of R28.5 million in the year. This equates to 150% of his guaranteed package. Isaacs, Ngumeni and Rylands received awards in the performance share plan (PSP) with a face value totalling R20.6 million (equivalent to 100% of their guaranteed pay). ‘Roles recognised’ Additionally: “The committee recognised the roles that the executive directors and other key individuals perform in ensuring that the group delivers sustainable returns for shareholders and the delivery of the long-term strategy. Against this context, restricted shares, with a total value of R56 million, were awarded to the group finance director, chief operating officer and CEO of Woolworths SA.” Isaacs received RSP shares with a face value of twice his guaranteed pay, while Ngumeni and Rylands received RSP shares with a face value of triple their guaranteed pay. These vest over the next five years. All long-term incentives will be measured against the following performance conditions: Source: Woolworths The group has been under fire on its disclosure of remuneration, with only 60% of shareholders voting in favour of the non-binding resolution on the implementation report last year. Because this failed to clear the 75% threshold, the group engaged with dissenting shareholders via a conference call in December. Following this, the group notes “a specific workshop dedicated to these matters was held by the remuneration committee”. It states: “Informed by these discussions, changes have been made to the remuneration policy and we have enhanced the disclosure in the implementation report.” The group has introduced “malus and clawback provisions” in both the short- and long-term incentive schemes. It removed the group profit trigger for the short-term incentive scheme, and this now applies at the operating entity level. Woolworths also now discloses long-term incentive targets in significantly more detail, along with “additional disclosure of the linkage of strategy and the individual executive director’s goals”, and says “more clarity [is] provided in the retrospective targets of elements of the … short-term incentive scheme. Shareholders will vote on remuneration and other matters at the group’s AGM on November 27. Hilton Tarrant works at YFM. He can still be contacted at hilton@moneyweb.co.za.

Heineken, the world’s second-largest brewer, forecast that growth in operating profit will slow this year as the Dutch brewer sold less beer than expected in Africa and the Americas. Earnings growth is set to rise about 4% this year, down from a rate of 6.4% last year. Heineken’s previous forecast was for a mid-single-digit increase. Key insights Double-digit growth in Asia, which has been dominated by Anheuser-Busch InBev, helped offset a decline in the US. Heineken is the first of the major brewers to report third-quarter results. Competitors AB InBev and Carlsberg A/S are expected to benefit from demand in Mexico and China, respectively. The Dutch brewer’s namesake brand had double-digit growth in markets such as Brazil, South Africa, the UK and Germany. The company has been depending more on Heineken’s strong performance lately as consumers move from low-end beers to international premium brands in developing markets. Market reaction The shares fell 1.9% early Wednesday in Amsterdam. The stock has gained about 24% this year. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P.

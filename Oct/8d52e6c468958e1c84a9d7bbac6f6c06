Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s largest brewer, reported that earnings growth ground to a halt in the third quarter on a decline in shipments in the US and China. The Budweiser maker lowered its full-year earnings forecast, saying Friday that it expects “moderate” growth, down from “strong” previously. Earnings were flat on an adjusted basis, missing analysts’ estimates for 3% growth. The rest of the year looks difficult, underlined by a 5.9% drop in Chinese volume a month after AB InBev raised $5.8 billion selling a stake in its Asian unit Budweiser Brewing Company APAC to the public. That raises concern that one of the beer industry’s growth motors is sputtering after China’s economy slowed to the weakest pace since the 1990s. In the US, the emergence of hard seltzers is eroding consumption of beer, and so the company is expanding in that segment with brands such as Bon & Viv and an upcoming Bud Light Seltzer. Other factors that hit the brewer in the quarter were higher raw material costs, adverse currency swings and declines in volume in South Korea and Brazil in response to price increases. AB InBev said that the second half of 2019 poses more challenging comparisons. Last year, most marketing spending occurred in the first half, linked to the World Cup soccer games, while this year it’s more spread out. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P.

It has once again come to our attention that certain emails and documents are doing the rounds, using Moneyweb’s name and logo to sell fraudulent loans and money transfers. The entity calls itself ‘MONEYWEB PRIVATE BANKING SOUTH AFRICA’ and promises various loans at an interest rate of 2% per year. We wish to clarify that these emails and documents are not sent from or by Moneyweb and that we have no connection with this entity whatsoever. Examples of these fraudulent documents can be seen here:    If you have any further queries you can direct them to editor@moneyweb.co.za

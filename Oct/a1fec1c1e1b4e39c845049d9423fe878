Carlsberg has seen the future of the beer bottle, and it’s made of paper. The Danish brewer is presenting two research prototype bottles made from wood fiber and lined with a polymer barrier at the World Mayors Summit in Copenhagen Friday. The company is also working with Coca-Cola, Pernod Ricard SA’s Absolut vodka and cosmetics giant L’Oreal SA on a project that aims to develop more sustainable packaging alternatives. The world’s largest consumer-goods companies are working to reduce their environmental impact amid pressure from shoppers. Nestle SA has unveiled paper wrapping for Yes fruit and nut bars, while Unilever pledged earlier this week to halve its use of newly made plastic by 2025. Carlsberg has also stopped using plastic rings, commonly associated with marine pollution, to hold its six-pack aluminum cans, instead using drops of glue to bind the beers. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P.

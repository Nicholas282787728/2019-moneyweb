The Public Investment Corporation (PIC) is the largest asset manager in Africa. In the year to March, it managed some R3.2 trillion of assets – 86.75% of which it manages on behalf of the Government Employees Pension Fund (GEPF). But is the PIC being transparent in its asset management? Having been in the spotlight at the commission of inquiry established in October 2018 to delve into allegations of impropriety regarding its investments, the PIC now appears to have clammed up completely. The commission, presided over by Judge Lex Mpati, will submit its final report to President Cyril Ramaphosa on October 31. Investments in financial assets and financial instruments The PIC’s 2019 integrated annual report provides no detailed disclosure of listed and unlisted investments, bonds, loans, and unpaid interest. It doesn’t even indicate the rand value of the allocation between listed and unlisted investments, bonds, and loans. This is all there is: R million 2019 2018 2017 Financial assets 1 786 1 669 1 458 Financial instruments 522 575 394 2 308 2 244 1 852 Apart from a R121 million unrealised loss on investments mentioned by the Auditor-General (AG) in his audit report, it doesn’t appear that any further impairments were made. In other words, the R4.3 billion investment in Ayo Technology Solutions must still be valued at that amount. When will the PIC take a haircut on this investment? According to a schedule of investments dated September 30, 2018, the PIC held investments in a number of other entities that have since lost value, such as VBS Mutual Bank, Lancaster 101 (which held shares in Steinhoff), Brait, Choppies Enterprises and EOH. Where is the impairment? Investments in associates (equity method) R million 2018 2018 2017 Investments in associates 159 107 102 These investments include Harith Fund Managers of R2 million (negative) (2018: R0.2 million negative), Harith General Partners of R123 million (2018: R97 million), and South African SME Fund of R38 million (2018: R9 million). The AG issued an unqualified audit report with findings The findings are briefly set out below: General observations of the audited financial statements (GEPF, take note) PIC media release dated October 15 The media release, in my view, does not provide any meaningful information. Some excerpts are set out below: Conclusion The PIC paid a dividend of R80 million (2018: R60 million) to its shareholder, the government. That’s rich. The government has a R1 000 equity investment in the PIC, and gets paid an R80 million dividend off the back of income on assets that surely belong mainly to the GEPF? The PIC should be removed from government interference, corruption and ineptitude. There is no reason for the government to hang onto it, other than to use it as a slush fund. However, there is also no requirement for the GEPF to have its assets managed by the PIC.

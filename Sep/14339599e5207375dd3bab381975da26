Hundreds of protesters staged a sit-in at the entrance to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange to call for an end to gender-based violence in South Africa. The demonstration, which began before dawn on Friday, disrupted traffic in the country’s main economic hub of Sandton. It’s the latest in a series of protests triggered by the rape and murder of a 19-year-old university student in Cape Town last month. Crime statistics released on Thursday show 2 771 women were murdered in South Africa in the 12 months through March. The number of reported rapes rose 3.9% to 41,583 in the period.

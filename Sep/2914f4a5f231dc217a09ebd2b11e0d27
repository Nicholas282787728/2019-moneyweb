WeWork has picked Nasdaq as the venue for its embattled listing and has also announced a series of governance changes to assuage investor concerns. The company said in a filing statement Friday that it would also change its high-vote stock from 20 votes to 10 votes a share, and said no member of co-founder’s Adam Neumann’s family will sit on the board. WeWork had been targeting a share sale of about $3.5 billion in September, people familiar with the matter said in July. A listing of that size would be second only to Uber Technologies’ $8.1 billion listing and ahead of Avantor’s $2.9 billion IPO and the $2.34 offering by Uber’s ride-hailing rival Lyft. After WeWork filed publicly for the offering in August, the company’s valuation shrank amid investor scrutiny. SoftBank Group Corp., which with its affiliates is WeWork’s biggest backer, invested in January at a valuation of $47 billion. Both of its lead financial advisers — JPMorgan Chase & Co and Goldman Sachs Group — have concerns about proceeding with an IPO, people said. The company is now expected to be worth as little as $15 billion in the IPO, people familiar with the matter have said. WeWork’s original IPO plan includes three classes of common stock, with holders of Class A shares getting one vote per share while Class B and Class C owners got 20 votes for each. This arrangement would have given Neumann the majority of the voting power. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P.

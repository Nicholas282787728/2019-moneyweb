Blue Label Telecoms will take an almost R2.88/share hit to its headline earnings per share for the full-year to May 31 2019 thanks to the ongoing woes at Cell C, it warned on Thursday. The share price fell to an all-time low of R2.51 shortly after the trading statement was released, but recovered ground to R2.65 shortly after 11.30 am. Read: JSE warns Blue Label about late results Can Cell C be saved? Blue Label said in a trading statement on Thursday that the Cell C impairments and trading losses, coupled with other challenges, including at its operations in India, will serve as a major drag its full-year headline earnings — to the tune of R4.05/share. Fair-value downward adjustments and trading losses and impairments in its Indian operations will also knock the numbers lower, it warned. These factors will knock its earnings per share by R8.23, with the Cell C trading losses and related impairments amounting to negative EPS of R6.71/share. Although the core businesses of the Blue Label group continued to generate profits, the negative contributions to the May 2019 basic, headline and core headline earnings per share were attributable to: “After taking into account the increase in the weighted average number of shares in issue, core headline earnings per share from the balance of the entities within the Blue Label group are expected to be between 96.95c and 100.95c for the year ended 31 May 2019, compared to 83.65c in the prior year. This represents an increase of between 16% and 21% on the prior year.”  — (c) 2019 NewsCentral Media This article was published with the permission of TechCentral.

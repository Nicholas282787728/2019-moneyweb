Zimbabwe’s central bank raised its main interest rate to 70% to stabilise a plummeting currency and rein in surging inflation. The decision is the first by the southern African nation’s Monetary Policy Committee, which was formed three days ago. The increase follows the government’s decision in June to ban the use of foreign currency and reintroduce the Zimbabwe dollar, abandoned in 2009, in an effort to manage consumer prices rising at the fastest pace in a decade.

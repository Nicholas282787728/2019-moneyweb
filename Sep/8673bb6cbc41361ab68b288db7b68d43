The acting chief executive of South Africa’s state power firm Eskom said on Wednesday that he could not rule out more power cuts going forward. Jabu Mabuza told a briefing that Eskom was planning to undertake plant maintenance on 5 500 MW of capacity over the next seven months. The utility’s coal stocks were at 50 days, excluding the Medupi and Kusilie power stations, he added.

Chinese food and beverage stocks are getting more expensive than their peers worldwide following a blockbuster 2019 rally. Pork prices have shot through the roof due to African swine fever decimating the pig population, while the trade war has also driven demand for domestic consumer stocks as investors seek assets relatively immune to tariffs. Excluding unprofitable firms and those with a market value below $1 billion, six of the 10 food and beverage stocks with the highest price-earnings ratios globally are Chinese as of Friday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The lofty valuations — pig breeder Luoniushan Co., for example, has a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of about 1 900 times — can fuel bubble concerns as they defy China’s slowing economy and stray far from the modestly priced benchmark index. The Shanghai Composite Index has a PE ratio of 14.5 times.  On a PE scale for food and beverage companies, the top spots are all taken by Chinese firms. The average ratio of the five is more than 600 times. The highest among companies globally with a market value above $1 billion is California-based software developer ServiceNow, which trades at more than 20 000 times earnings. This clutch of Chinese food and beverage stocks is unlikely to sustain such high valuations, said Shen Zhengyang, a strategist with Northeast Securities “The craziest period for investors to buy pork feeders is about to be behind us,” Shen said. A gauge of 49 Chinese food and beverage stocks has surged 68% this year, hitting a record high last week, while the Shanghai Composite has advanced 21%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index is up just 3.3%. China’s wholesale pork spot price jumped to a record high last month. Vice Premier Hu Chunhua urged measures to resume hog breeding and boost pork supply on September 2, the official Xinhua news agency reported.

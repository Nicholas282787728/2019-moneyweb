South Africa’s RCL Foods met expectations with a 61% drop in annual profit on Monday, sending its shares higher as investors cheered its efforts in the face of an oversupplied poultry sector and a recently implemented sugar tax. The owner of Rainbow chicken and maker of Selati sugar reported headline earning per share (Heps) for the 12 months to June 30 of 37.9 cents, down from 96.8 cents but just above the 37 cents expected by analysts, IBES data from Refinitiv showed.

The big one was sugar. The sugar tax has dramatically affected the consumption of local sugar,” McCurrie said. Its sugar business recorded an earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) loss of R84.5 million ($5.55 million), despite a 5% increase in revenue. Its chicken business reported a 54.1% fall in Ebitda to R214.3 million. Chicken imports have risen, mainly from Brazil and the United States, and more recently from European Union markets after the lifting of Avian Influenza bans against affected countries, it said. “The significant impact of the sugar tax and unabated growing chicken imports dragged down the performance of the agricultural categories,” RCL said, adding the company was seeking a level playing field for local producers from the government and industry stakeholders. South Africa’s sugar tax could slash industry revenue by up to $129 million in the 2018-19 marketing year and prompt restructuring in the sector, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) said in a report in March.

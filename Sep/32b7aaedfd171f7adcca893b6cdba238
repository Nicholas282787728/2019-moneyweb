Egyptian stocks extended losses and dollar bonds fell after small but rare anti-government protests over the weekend. The EGX 30 dropped as much as 0.9% on Monday, before paring its loss to 0.3% as of 11:21 am in Cairo. That extended its biggest drop since 2016 on Sunday after rallies in several cities evoked memories of the instability that followed the 2011 uprising and ouster of former President Hosni Mubarak. The country’s $1.75 billion of bonds due 2029 headed for the biggest decline since they were sold in February, while 12-month non-deliverable forward contracts for the Egyptian pound rose the most since March 2017, a sign that pressure on the currency may be rising. Before Sunday’s slump, the equities gauge had been one of the top four performing indexes among major peers tracked by Bloomberg globally this year in dollar terms. Investors cheered reforms that spurred the economy, while the inflation rate fell to the lowest level since 2013 in August. Carry traders buying the Egyptian pound benefited from some of the highest yields in the world. The market turmoil comes days before that central bank is scheduled to decide on monetary policy. Economists predict a 125 basis-point cut to the deposit rate.

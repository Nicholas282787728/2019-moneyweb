The Brazilian real will be the strongest emerging-market currency performer in the event of a US-China trade deal, while the Thai baht and Israeli shekel are among those that will be the least responsive, a Bloomberg analysis shows. Based on sensitivity to the yuan during periods of trade-newsflow driven markets, commodity-exporter currencies including the Chilean peso and the Russian ruble showed the most consistent and largest moves. Asian currencies including the won and the ringgit also show consistently large moves, while those ranked at the bottom were all lower-yielding commodity importers. Investors are preparing for the outcome of the latest round of high-level talks between the worldâ€™s two largest economies, set to take place during the week of October 7.

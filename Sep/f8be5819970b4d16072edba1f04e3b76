The 2019 Economic Freedom of the World annual report was released last Thursday. Produced by the Fraser Institute in cooperation with the Economic Freedom Network, a group of related bodies in nearly 100 countries and territories, its index ratings are based on data from sources such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Economic Forum. The report ranks 162 countries and territories – with Hong Kong at number one, Singapore second, the US fifth and Canada eighth. South Africa is ranked at 101. Mauritius is in ninth position, while Botswana is at 49 and Zambia at 83. Of the Brics countries, India is 79th, Russia 85th, China 113rd, and Brazil 120th. The index provides a measurement of the degree to which countries’ policies and institutions are supportive of economic freedoms in five areas: There are 25 components in the index, and 43 distinct variables.

Not an impressive track record to attract any new foreign investment. When interference and control eclipses personal choice … Self-ownership is a fundamental cornerstone of economic freedom – the right of personal choice, voluntary exchange, open markets, and property rights. Therefore, a country should provide the infrastructure to ensure this. A political process that interferes with the right of choice or “the use of violence, theft or fraud by others” will negatively impact economic freedom. In other words, a country should protect its citizens. “Economic freedom is reduced when taxes, government expenditure, and regulations are substituted for personal choice, voluntary exchange, and market coordination,” states the report. This concept is particularly pertinent for South Africans. State corruption is being laid bare before the Zondo Commission of Inquiry, the ailing mismanaged state-owned entities are requiring bailout after bailout, government debt is spiralling out of control, government is proposing to interfere in private medical care, and there is the omnipresent threat of higher taxes. One doesn’t need to be a mathematician nor an economist to realise that this must negatively impact the economy. Freedom and entrepreneurship versus public policy The data in the report shows that economic freedom is associated with more innovative entrepreneurship, and firms in countries with greater economic freedom receive more patents. The intangible assets in these countries more than double those in the least economically free countries. It is now recognised that entrepreneurs play a critical role in stimulating economic progress. Public policy should therefore support and foster entrepreneurs. There is an argument as to whether the quality or the quantity of entrepreneurs is the most important outcome of any intervention. The emphasis in South Africa, however, appears to be more focused on raising taxes on owners of capital and strangling them in bureaucracy and regulations – ranging from repressive labour laws to black economic empowerment legislation. In 1980 South Africa moved from the third quartile (the fourth quartile is the least free) to the second quartile, and in 2006 it moved back to the third quartile. It is a somewhat depressing scenario, and this is not the only red flag indicating that South Africa is regressing. The economic freedom index joins many others that point to a decline in the economy.

Clashes erupted in South Africa after a taxi driver was shot dead on August 27, allegedly by a suspected Nigerian drug dealer, in the capital, Pretoria. Scores of foreign-owned shops were looted and torched in the ensuing violence. The attacks spread to Johannesburg, leaving at least 12 people dead and more than 50 shops and several vehicles destroyed. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P.

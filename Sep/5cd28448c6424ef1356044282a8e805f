Livestream starts at 8:30am In nature, there are four elements that work together to create and sustain life as we know it: earth, air, fire and water. Although they’re unpredictable and behave erratically at times, they can be harnessed and manipulated to our advantage. The same can be said for investment strategies, in that they’re not always predictable or controllable. However, with the right expertise, a little foresight, agility and financial acumen, they can be utilised to our benefit. This continuous pursuit for mastery of the elements is something that differentiates Alexander Forbes Investments and what gives us the Foursight to invest in a sustainable future.

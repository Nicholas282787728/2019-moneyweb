Fitch Ratings downgraded Hong Kong as an issuer of long-term, foreign currency debt, saying that the territory’s recent political turmoil raises doubts about its governance framework. The rating was lowered to AA from AA+ with a negative outlook, the company said in an emailed statement Friday. “Months of persistent conflict and violence are testing the perimeters and pliability of the “one country, two systems” framework that governs Hong Kong’s relationship with the mainland,” according to the statement. “The gradual rise in Hong Kong’s economic, financial, and socio-political linkages with the mainland implies its continued integration into China’s national governance system, which will present greater institutional and regulatory challenges over time.” © 2019 Bloomberg L.P.

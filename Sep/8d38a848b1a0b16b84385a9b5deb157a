Zimbabwe’s central bank has clamped down on mobile money, banning the purchase and sale of cash through the services, in the latest directive aimed at gaining control of a monetary system that’s spiraling out of control. The directive, which the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe said was necessary because of commissions charged by agents, follows a September 28 announcement enforcing the use of the Zimbabwe dollar and banning the quoting of prices in foreign currency. Ecocash, a mobile-money service operated by Econet Wireless Zimbabwe, has 6.7 million active users in a nation of about 14 million people. It’s the first time since its introduction in 2011 that its users haven’t been able to use the so-called cash-back service. Since the Zimbabwe dollar was reintroduced in June its value has plunged to 15.19 to the US dollar from an initial rate of 2.5. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P.

South African lender Capitec said on Thursday its half-year earnings could rise by up to 21%, without giving a reason. Headline earnings per share (Heps) for the half-year ending August 31 are expected to be between 2 511 and 2 575 cents per share versus 2 128 cents a year earlier, Capitec said. Heps strips out certain one-off items and is the most widely watched profit measure in South Africa.

The South African government will announce its strategy to turn around ailing Eskom after it finalises a master plan to revive the economy, according to Minister in the Presidency Jackson Mthembu. Cabinet members held a special meeting Thursday to discuss an economic draft formulated by the National Treasury, Mthembu told reporters in Cape Town. They also discussed a blueprint, known as the Integrated Resources Plan, that maps out the nation’s energy mix for the next two decades, he said. Eskom, which supplies about 95% of South Africa’s power, has been granted R128 billion ($8.7 billion) in state bailouts over the next three years to remain solvent. The government has proposed splitting the utility into generation, transmission and distribution units and is evaluating a range of options to reduce the costs of the debt and improve its performance. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P.

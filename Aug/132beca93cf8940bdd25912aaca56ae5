South African President Cyril Ramaphosa secured a High Court interdict suspending a directive from the nation’s graft ombudsman that parliament censure him for failing to properly declare a campaign donation pending a review of the finding. Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane said Ramaphosa misled lawmakers about a donation to his 2017 campaign to win control of the ruling party and instructed them to take action against him for violating the constitution and the executive ethics code. The president has challenged the finding in court, saying he didn’t know about the R500 000 ($32 450) payment, inadvertently failed to disclose it and rectified his mistake as soon as possible. Mkhwebane didn’t oppose Ramaphosa’s application for the disciplinary action to be put on hold until the conclusion of review, a date for which has yet to be set. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P.

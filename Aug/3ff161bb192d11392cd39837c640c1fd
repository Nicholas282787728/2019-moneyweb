Joburg residents serviced by City Power who are billed monthly pay the most for electricity among the major metros in South Africa. This is due to two fixed monthly charges – a network charge and capacity charge which together total R631.16 including value-added tax (Vat) per month. An analysis by Moneyweb that compares the tariffs for a single-phase 60A residential connection to a single point of supply (which obviously excludes bulk supply to sectional title schemes) shows the stark differences in tariffs between the major metro municipalities as well as those directly supplied by Eskom (Sandton and Soweto). Tariff structures across the various metros are exceedingly complicated and almost entirely not comparable. Those which charge different rates depending on levels of usage (so-called inclining block tariffs) don’t use the same sized blocks. Some have flat-rated tariffs. Others, like Tshwane, bill seasonally with different rates for summer and winter (City Power also bills seasonally on certain 80A tariff plans, excluded from this comparison). Comparing apples with apples Rather than comparing base tariffs levied in terms of cents per kilowatt hour (kWh), the methodology calculates how much electricity a household will receive for three amounts: R500, R1 000, R1 500. This is the lived experience of customers. Importantly, fixed charges on some tariff structures distort matters making a simple comparison between the rates per kWh meaningless. This methodology removes this distortion. In Joburg, because of the fixed charges, there is a sharp divergence between effective tariffs on prepaid and those for credit customers. For R1 000, a prepaid customer will receive 575kWh, while for the same amount a credit customer will receive less than half of that (239kWh). The municipality attempted to introduce a monthly surcharge of R230 including Vat for prepaid customers in July but made an abrupt U-turn. Until it implements some sort of fixed monthly charge, City Power’s prepaid customers will continue to enjoy among the cheapest electricity in South Africa. Effectively, they are being subsidised by City Power’s credit (postpaid) customers.

Tshwane and eThekwini residents also receive comparatively little bang for their buck, given the fixed charges. At the R1 500 a month level, arguably a typical household, the divergence between tariffs is less stark. Residential customers in most metros will receive between 600kWh and 700kWh for that level of spend. Directly-supplied Eskom customers are the best off (as are City Power prepaid customers), netting around 800kWh for their spend.

These include one Eskom residential tariff (Homepower 4), which levies a network charge of R4.03 per day regardless of whether customers are on prepaid or credit, a fixed charge for Ekurhuleni residential customers on Tariff B, Cape Town’s Home User charge for houses valued at over R1 million, a steep service charge in eThekwini, and the controversial fixed monthly charge of R230 introduced by the City of Tshwane in July.

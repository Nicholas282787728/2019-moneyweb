The Post Office group announced the resignation of its CEO Mark Barnes on Thursday, citing differences in opinions on future strategy in relation to the structure of the SA Post Office group. The SA Post Office board and Barnes both agreed on an amicable separation, the statement says. During his three-and-a-half year tenure at the group, Barnes led the organisation’s stabilisation and positioned it as a relevant access point of government services for communities, according to the statement. “We assure our customers and the SA public at large that the departure of the outgoing CEO will not negatively impact the organisation’s operations as he leaves behind a capable team that he has built during his tenure.” Group COO Lindiwe Kwele has been appointed as interim CEO until a new candidate has been identified. Barnes will remain within the SA Post Office fold for a further amount of time to aid the transition of the interim group CEO.

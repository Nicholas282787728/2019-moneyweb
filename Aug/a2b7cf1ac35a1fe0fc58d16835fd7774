MTN Nigeria has asked a tax tribunal to decide whether it should pay corporate tax to the Nigerian government on a 330 billion naira ($1.1 billion) fine or be allowed to treat it as an operating cost, a spokesman for the telecoms firm said. The local unit of South African telecoms group MTN said on Friday it had requested a judicial review after the Nigerian tax authority disagreed with the companyâ€™s accounting treatment of the fine as an operating cost.

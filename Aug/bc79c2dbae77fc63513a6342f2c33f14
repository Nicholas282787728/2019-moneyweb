South Africa‘s Woolworths expects full year earnings to decline as it again wrote down the value of its David Jones business due to structural changes that have hurt the Australian retail sector. Woolworths, which sells clothes and organic food, said it would book an impairment of 437.4 million Australian dollars ($299.27 million) against David Jones, reducing the valuation of the upmarket chain to about 965 million Australian dollars.

In 2018, Woolworths booked a non-cash impairment charge of 712.5 million Australian dollars against the value of David Jones due to the same reasons. It said that it expected a loss per share for the full year of between 92.4 cents and 129.3 cents, compared to a loss of 369.5 cents in the same period last year. Headline earnings per share, which exclude the write down, are expected to either decline by 3.5% or rise by 1.5% from 346.3 cents.

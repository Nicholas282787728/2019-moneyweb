Toyota Motor was investigating a blaze on Friday at its headquarters in western Japanâ€™s Toyota City, believed to have broken out in the technology development division, a company spokeswoman said. All employees had been evacuated and no one was injured, she said. Public broadcaster NHK showed images of people leaving the building, although there appeared to be little sign of smoke. Toyota City is about 320 km (200 miles) west of Tokyo, the Japanese capital, and near the city of Nagoya.

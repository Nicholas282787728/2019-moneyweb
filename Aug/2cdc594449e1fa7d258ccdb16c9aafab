Bitcoin fell more than 8% on Wednesday, plumbing to a five-day low, with traders and analysts ascribing the losses to technical trading in thin liquidity. The biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation was last down 7.6% at $9 936, after touching $9 926 earlier. Traders said there did not appear to be a specific news catalyst for the moves, with some citing the possibility of large individual orders pressuring the broader market lower. Other major digital coins such as ethereum and rippleâ€™s XRP also fell by around 7%.

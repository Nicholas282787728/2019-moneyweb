South Africa is expected to harvest more maize in 2019 compared with the previous month’s forecast after higher crop yields in Limpopo, Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal provinces, the government’s Crop Estimates Committee (CEC) said on Tuesday. The CEC, which gave its seventh estimate for the 2018/2019 season, estimated production at 11.016 million tonnes compared with the July estimate of 10.913 million tonnes. The harvest is projected to consist of 5.572 million tonnes of the food staple white maize and 5.444 million tonnes of yellow maize which is primarily used for animal feed, said the CEC. The estimate for the 2018/2019 season is 13.56% less than the 12.510 million tonnes harvested in the 2017/2018 season after dry weather delayed plantings. The harvest is 4.32% higher than projected by the Reuters survey of traders and analysts, which pegged the harvest at 10.56 million tonnes.

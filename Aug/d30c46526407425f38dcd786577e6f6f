The Industrial Development Corporation is an odd organisation. It is state-owned, but not dependant on the state for financing. It offers ‘development’ financing, but is also a major shareholder in some of South Africa’s largest companies. This effectively means it can lose millions on some projects, but also increase profits by re-evaluating some of its holdings. All this makes figuring out basic things about the IDC tricky. Did it make a profit? For example, operating expenses for 2019 amounted to R3.9 billion, compared with R6.9 billion incurred in 2018. No reason is given for the improvement in operating expenses. However, this gain was offset by: The net deferred tax adjustment (deferred tax asset of R599 million less deferred tax liability of R25 million) raised the operating profit to R720 million. Further accounting adjustments, including a fair value adjustment on equity instruments of R10.6 billion, raised the total comprehensive income for the year to R10.5 billion (2018: R3.8 billion). On the other hand, profit for the year before any IFRS-related adjustments, or sale of investments, is only R418 million (2018: loss of R1.4 billion). Just saying. Investments and loans – increasing impairments The IDC does not provide details of the entities in which it has invested or provided loans to. However, page 63 of the 2019 annual report provides a breakdown of the industries in which investments are made. The largest of these are shown below. Largest investments (equities and loans) by industry 2019 2018 Rm % Rm % Chemicals and petroleum 26.5 30.7 24.1 27.3 Mining 25.6 29.7 20.5 23.2 Metals and machinery 15.6 18.1 14.9 16.9 Total investments 86.2  88.2  Loans and advances were impaired by an amount of R9.7 billion or 27.3% (2018: R5.2 billion and 14.4%), reducing the amount recoverable to R25.9 billion (2018: R30.7 billion). The fair value of investments (listed equities, unlisted equities and preference shares) is sitting at R60.3 billion (2018: R57.5 billion). Details of the entities invested in is not provided. The fair value adjustment to equity instruments (disclosed under other comprehensive income) is R10.6 billion. There is no note explaining this adjustment, nor to which investments it is attributed. Investments in associates (including loans) is valued at R32.7 billion (2018: R24 billion). Equity accounted losses and impairments were R12.4 billion (2018: R11.8 billion) and loans were impaired by R4.6 billion (2018: R2.1 billion). Further investments of R13.1 billion (2018: R15.4 billion) were approved during the year. No details were provided as to an allocation between loans and equity, nor across industries. The number of jobs created or saved came to 17 887, short of the target of 34 795. Reserves The IDC has strong reserves of R52.6 billion (2018: R45 billion) and retained income of R41.6 billion (2018: R45.5 billion). However, the statement of changes in equity contains a few complex adjustments: The big question is: are these reserves diminishing in real terms? Group borrowings (Rm) Foreign loans Domestic loans  Finance costs of R2.9 billion (2018: R2.3 billion) were incurred. The significant increase in borrowings will result in increased finance costs, which will have to be covered by an improvement in operating profits. Cash flow The net cash from operating activities was positive, mainly due to less spent on operating assets, R3.8 billion (2018: R7.5 billion), and an increase in operating liabilities to R6.3 billion (2018: R2.8 billion). Proceeds on the realisation of investments amounted to R2.7 billion (2018: R2.4 billion), and investments were acquired for R3.3 billion (2018: R2.1 billion). The ‘acquisition’ of investments includes loans granted. The cash flow statement does not provide details of borrowings repaid, nor of additional loans raised. Group cash and cash equivalents (Rm)  Cash and balances with bank Negotiable securities Bank overdraft  No details have been provided in regard to the R7 billion negotiable securities. And why would the IDC have a bank overdraft when it has ‘cash and balances’ with the bank? Audit report The external auditors, SizweNtsalubaGobodo-Grant Thornton and Ngubane & Co, provided an unqualified audit opinion. However, they found that the financial statements were not prepared in accordance with the prescribed financial reporting framework as required by the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA). Material misstatements identified by the auditors were corrected. A reportable irregularity was identified – an executive failed to declare a conflict of interest with a family member. A disciplinary inquiry found him  guilty. Irregular expenditure, relating to ‘business support’, amounted to R5.5 million. Fruitless and wasteful expenditure for 2018 of R2.6 million, which included an interest payment to the South African Revenue Service of R1.9 million, was written off. Moving forward The IDC should provide details of its major investments, as well as a reconciliation of how it intends to fund the proposed further investment of R13.1 billion. Greater disclosure should also be provided in the cash flow statement. Any large adjustment should be referenced by a note to the financial statements. The IDC is continuing on its slumbering slide, increasing its reliance on funding from external sources. With foreign loans of R9.8 billion, it faces higher finance costs resulting from the falling rand. The deferred tax asset of R1.8 billion (2018: R487 million), which lacks an explanatory note, indicates an increasing assessed loss. This does not augur well for the future. The IDC has to meet a bundle of conflicting priorities, jumping to the tune set by every ‘plan’ dreamt up by government – from industrial action to agricultural action. This is perhaps a bridge too far. It is time for the IDC to take stock of its priorities – growing the investments it already has, without eroding its capital base.

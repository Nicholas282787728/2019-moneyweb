Clough USA has been awarded a petrochemical engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) project in the United States worth $620 million, South African parent firm Murray & Roberts said on Monday. “This multi-year project signifies Clough USA’s first major contract award and underlines the successful establishment of Clough in North America,” Murray & Roberts said in a statement. The wholly owned subsidiary was established earlier this year following Murray & Roberts’ acquisition of Saulsbury Industries’ Gulf Coast downstream EPC business. Clough USA has secured a limited notice to proceed and should receive the full notice to proceed by October, the firm said.

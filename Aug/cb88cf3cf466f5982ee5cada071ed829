There exists a school of thought that (especially bank) CEOs are substantially overpaid for the work they do. One might even say this criticism is fair in a season of rampant value destruction and poor capital allocation among public companies. The Twittersphere was abuzz last week when Sasfin’s David Shapiro cited Financial Mail money editor Giulietta Talevi, who mentioned that Standard Bank’s executive and non-executive remuneration had soared by 890% over 10 years. Contrast this with a reported total return of 161% over the same period. (Talevi then clarified her calculation and said that when taking share rights into account, the increase was 671%.) Chatting to @GTalevi she tells me that Standard Bank’s executive and non-executive bill has gone up from R33m in 2009 to R327m in 2018. That’s up 890%. Total return meanwhile on Standard Bank’s shares over past 10 years is 161%. Staggering. What say the bank analysts? — David Shapiro (@davidshapiro61) August 13, 2019  However, 280 characters cannot tell the whole story. For one thing, in 2009 Standard Bank disclosed the remuneration of only two executives: then CEO Jacko Maree and then financial director Simon Ridley (before that, it only reported on one: the CEO). Contrast this with 2018 when it published details for six executives. The board still comprises 19 directors, but sub-committee fees are an increasing portion of fees paid to non-executives. Let’s start with the total returns of the five retail banks in the past 10 years. Total returns 2008 – 2018 Capitec 5 002.04% FirstRand 647.94% Nedbank 355.79% Standard Bank 233.22% Absa Group 170.34% * Sasfin helpfully provided this data, measured from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2018. * Investec is excluded from this exercise as its remuneration is in pounds sterling. How did remuneration paid to executives increase across over the same period? For the purposes of this comparison, only guaranteed or fixed pay and benefits as well as bonuses or short-term incentives were used. This rather obviously excludes a large portion of an executive’s remuneration, particularly at a bank. However, long-term incentives – whether these are phantom shares, share appreciation rights, share options, or performance-related shares – are complicated. One cannot simply take the number granted or, indeed, exercised in two arbitrary years. Awards given in a single year for performance will typically vest over a period of time. And even then, those are subject to additional criteria or hurdles.

At Standard Bank, the remuneration of CEO Sim Tshabalala last year was 505% higher than that of then CEO Jacko Maree in 2009. This is more than double the total return delivered over the 10 years of 233%. While the remuneration of former FirstRand CEO Johan Burger was 227% higher than that of Paul Harris a decade ago, the banking group has delivered a total return of nearly three times that. At Nedbank, with more modest increases in remuneration of both the CEO and CFO over the decade, the total return of 356% also comfortably exceeds the increase in pay. And with Capitec’s astonishing total return of 5 002% over the decade, it would be near impossible for the increase in CEO pay to come anywhere close! Future comparisons It is worth noting that this comparison would be distorted if the new single-figure method of disclosing remuneration is used. For this, the value of any long-term incentives vesting are disclosed as part of remuneration for the current year. In the case of Capitec, for example, CEO Gerrie Fourie’s remuneration would be more than R78 million higher due to awards from prior years that vested. These are measured against the year-end share price but have not actually been exercised. One must therefore ask whether this is an accurate way to measure remuneration within a given year. Even so, the increase in remuneration at Capitec would be approximately 1 000% if the ‘single figure’ for Fourie is used in the most recent year (understandable, given that so much is tied to the value of the bank’s share price). A similar comparison for Standard Bank using the ‘single figure’ would yield a result of 892%. But Maree’s remuneration in 2009 was less than half of what he had been paid a year prior. This further highlights the limitation in using just two arbitrary years as the basis for comparison. One way to more accurately measure this would be to compare the total reward paid to an executive across their tenure (including the value of all vested and exercised long-term incentives) with the bank’s total return across that same period. A ratio of the two – rands per percentage return generated (or rands vs increase in return on equity?) – would provide a better basis for comparing bank performance  and the remuneration of their leaders.

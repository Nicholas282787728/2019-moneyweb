South Africaâ€™s KAP Industrial on Tuesday reported a 25% fall in full-year profit citing the impact of an accounting change on a black economic empowerment transaction. Headline earnings per share (Heps) stood at 45.9 cents per share in the year to June 30, down from 61.6 cents per share a year earlier. Heps strips out certain one-off items and is the main profit gauge in South Africa.

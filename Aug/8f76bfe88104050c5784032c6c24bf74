South African labour unions that oppose the government’s plans to split embattled state-owned power utility Eskom into three units will ultimately have to support the reforms, according to mineral resources and energy minister Gwede Mantashe. Eskom, which supplies about 95% of the nation’s electricity and is seen as the biggest threat to the economy, is reliant on government bailouts as it struggles under R440 billion ($28.6 billion) of debt while reporting annual losses. Mantashe is one of the key officials charged with ensuring that there is a reliable power supply and Eskom becomes financially sustainable.

Both labour groups have rejected plans to separate Eskom into generation, distribution and transmission units under a state holding company, fearing the move would be precursor to privatisation and job losses.

Technologies being considered to replace ageing coal stations include modular nuclear plants, gas, hydro, solar and wind, he said. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P.

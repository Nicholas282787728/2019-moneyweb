The trade war is taking a turn for the worse just as investors digest one of the roughest weeks for emerging markets this year. China pledged to retaliate after President Donald Trump threatened to put 10% tariffs on a further $300 billion of the country’s goods. The escalation puts the Asian nation’s trade data on Thursday in the spotlight amid concern the year-long dispute is hurting its economy.

Morgan Stanley turned bearish on emerging-market credit soon after removing a bullish call on currencies. Investors will also be paying attention to Turkey, which publishes inflation data Monday, and Russia, after the US announced fresh sanctions. The central banks of the Philippines and India are forecast to lower rates this week, and South Korea is preparing to announce details of a plan to remove Japan from its easy-trade list as the countries’ political standoff intensifies. “This once again shows that it’s foolish to make long-term predictions on markets and anchor positions to predictions,” said Nader Naeimi, AMP Capital’s head of dynamic markets in Sydney. “I can’t remember any other time that agility and flexibility was so paramount.” Trump thumps China More rate cuts Brazil’s pension overhaul Economic highlights © 2019 Bloomberg L.P.

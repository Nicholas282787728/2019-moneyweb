The ministers of finance and of public enterprises have proposed that a chief restructuring office (CRO) be established to sort out Eskom’s financial position. Read: Eskom has 18 months to get its house in order The CEO of the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (Saica), Freeman Nomvalo, will lead a team of specialists in establishing this office. It is to be noted that: Three immediate questions arise from this proposal Potential investors and the rating agencies will no doubt be interested in: 1. Nomvalo’s expertise (with the backing of Saica) in debt restructuring, corporate finance, debt management and balance sheet optimisation? 2. The length of time this process will take? 3. Whether the appointments made in “corporate finance, debt management and balance sheet optimisation” will have to comply with black economic empowerment (BEE) requirements? Will the establishment of this office be sufficient to stay South Africa’s imminent downgrade to junk? It is unlikely that rating agencies (or investors) will have the patience to wait for concrete results (for example, a turnaround in collecting debt and cutting costs). Are rating agencies not tired of government’s empty promises? (An analysis of empty promises over the last couple of years will fill an article on its own.) Never mind ‘restructuring’ the debt Eskom has an interesting risk profile, not great for raising money nor looking for investors: Looking for collateral value The carrying value of property, plant and equipment for 2019 is R651.6 billion (2018: R630.6 billion), and includes capitalised finance costs of R128 299 (19.7%) in 2019, and R112.9 billion (17.9%) in 2018.The annual capitalised finance costs for 2019 are R15.4 billion (2018: R15.5 billion). (It is to be noted that Eskom does not allocate the specific capitalised finance costs to generating, transmitting or distributing plant, nor to work under construction – hence, I have calculated the percentage of capitalised finance costs on the entire portfolio). Eskom is mandated in terms of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to capitalise its finance costs incurred in the construction of its plant and machinery. This means capitalised finance costs are not expensed to the income statement, but are amortised and deducted from profit when the plant is brought into production. (In the opinion of a cynic who does not believe in the infallible status of IFRS, capitalising finance costs in a zombie company riddled with corruption overstates the profits or understates the losses, and inflates the value of plant and machinery). My questions are: The impact of capitalised interest on the profits/losses Capitalising finance costs in a scenario where it takes longer to complete the construction of plant and bring it into production than it should will have the effect of overstating profits or understating losses. To illustrate the effect, I have calculated the impact on the annual and the cumulative profits/losses, shown below. Capitalised finance costs Including capitalised finance costs  2019 2009-2019 Total Loss for the year -20 729 -15 378 -36 107 Comprehensive loss for the year -17 044 -15 378 -32 422  Cumulative impact (Rm) Cumulative capitalised finance costs Cumulative adjusted loss 2019 2009-2019 Total Accumulated profit 2019 81 749 -128 299 -46 550 Accumulated profit 2018 97 898 -112 921 -15 023 To obtain a proper understanding of Eskom’s real loss, should the capitalised interest not be added back? Is this not what a rating agency would do?

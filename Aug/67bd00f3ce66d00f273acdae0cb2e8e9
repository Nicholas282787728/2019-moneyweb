Rwanda has closed its western border with the Democratic Republic of Congo over fears that the Ebola outbreak in the neighbouring country will spread, according to Rwandan Minister for Foreign Affairs Olivier Nduhungirehe. This comes after Congolese health authorities on Thursday said a one-year-old child died of the disease, making her the third fatality of the virus that has been detected in the eastern city of Goma. A key trade hub of about 1 million people on Lake Kivu, Goma borders the Rwandan city of Gisenyi. The girl was the daughter of the second victim who died on Wednesday, Aruna Abedi, the chief Ebola coordinator in North Kivu province, said in a statement. The World Health Organisation declared the second-deadliest outbreak of Ebola virus in history an international public health emergency in July. At the time the WHO asked that trade and borders not be closed so that food and supplies could still reach people in the region. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P.

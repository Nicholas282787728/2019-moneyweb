RMB responded by providing an innovative financing package for CIVH by overlaying an equity underwrite – the first of its kind for South Africa – as part of the suite of solutions that included financial and debt advisory, underwriting and debt funding. The transaction was named Private Equity Deal of the Year for 2018 by DealMakers magazine and won The Banker magazine’s Deal of the Year award in the High Yield and Leveraged Finance category for Africa. Gareth Armstrong, corporate finance transactor at RMB, talks to Moneyweb editor Ryk van Niekerk about the deal. Brought to you by Rand Merchant Bank (RMB).

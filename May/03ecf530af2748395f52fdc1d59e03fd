South Africa’s annual inflation slowed for the first time in three months, with the rate falling below the midpoint of the central bank’s target range, after moderation in food-price growth tempered an increase in the cost of gasoline. Annual consumer-price growth decelerated to 4.4% from a year earlier compared with 4.5% in March, the Pretoria-based Statistics South Africa said Wednesday in a statement on its website. The median estimate of 22 economists in a Bloomberg survey was 4.5%.  Underlying inflation pressures are receding with annual core inflation, which excludes the cost of food, non-alcoholic beverages, fuel and electricity, slowing to 4.1%, the weakest pace of increases since March 2018.  “This affirms our assessment that a run-up in transport inflation would be offset by a one-percentage point increase in value-added tax in April 2018 falling out of the annual comparison. We expect rising food prices and a modest increase in the contribution from transport costs should push inflation toward 5% in the next few quarters. We see inflation accelerating more rapidly in the second half of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 than the Reserve Bank is currently.” – Mark Bohlund, economist

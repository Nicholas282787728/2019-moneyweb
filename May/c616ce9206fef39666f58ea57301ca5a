A relatively stable rand, falling inflation expectations and steady interest rates have helped to resurrect corporate-bond sales in South Africa after a decline last year. Companies in Africa’s most industrialised economy have raised R65.5 billion ($4.5 billion) this year, compared with R42 billion in the comparable period in 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There is a shortage of corporate bonds with a good credit ratings in the market, and spreads keep compressing because demand outweighs supply,” said Michelle Wohlberg, a bond analyst at Rand Merchant Bank in Johannesburg. Still, corporate yield premiums “provide a nice uptick over government bonds,” she said.

South Africa’s budget deficit for the most recent fiscal year could be worse than government had forecast. The total shortfall for the year ended March 31 was R232.9 billion ($16.3 billion), National Treasury said in its monthly budget update on Tuesday. That exceeds government’s February projections of a R224.5 billion gap for the main budget and R210.2 billion for the consolidated budget.

The South African Revenue Service (Sars) said on April 1 that collections didn’t meet their target. The larger gap could point to a bigger consolidated fiscal shortfall than the 4.2% of GDP Treasury projected for 2018-19. This may be compounded by economic growth coming in slower than government estimated as power cuts weigh on output. 2019 Bloomberg L.P

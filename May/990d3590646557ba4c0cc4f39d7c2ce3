The Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) has published a draft conduct standard for determining the skills and training requirements for board members of pension funds. Comments are required by July 4. The standard seeks to prescribe the minimum skills and training requirements for board members of funds as contemplated in the Pension Funds Act, which requires that trustees (board members) of pension funds attain the levels that may be prescribed by the FSCA within six months of being appointed to such position – and that they maintain their skills and training throughout their term of appointment. The draft proposes that board members use the Trustee Training Toolkit provided by the FSCA, which includes two types of assessment: The FSCA says the toolkit has been designed with the aim of developing skills and providing training. It is not a qualification with a pass or fail outcome, and allows trustees to do the necessary within a reasonable period. The toolkit will provide board members with basic knowledge of the legislative requirements and information on fund governance, the responsibilities and obligations of board members towards the fund and its members, and guidance on what fit and proper conduct is deemed to be. Board members who attain certification will be required to complete additional modules as and when these are added to the toolkit by the FSCA. The draft conduct standard proposes that: In the event that a board member is unable to complete the toolkit within the prescribed time, they may apply to the FSCA for an extension. Submissions on the draft standard can be submitted in writing on or before July 4, 2019 to the FSCA at MinimumSkillsandTraining@fsca.co.za.

South African sugar producer Tongaat Hulett’s said on Friday its 2018 results could face a potential hit of up to R4.5 billion ($306.38 million) following a review of its accounting practices. Tongaat, which has operations in South Africa, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, said in March that newly appointed CEO Gavin Hudson was conducting the review and that it had revealed past accounting practices that might require remedial action. On Friday, Tongaat said it estimated a reduction in the amount reflected in the company’s equity as at April 1, 2018 to be between R3.5 billion and R4.5 billion. The company also said the impact was still being determined. Tongaat said its financial results for 2019 would include restated prior financial information and would be delayed and only released by October 2019. Tongaat’s shares were nearly 9% lower by 1310 GMT. Tongaat, whose net debt stood at R7.754 billion as of September 30, 2018, said in February it had entered into discussions with its lenders. The company appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers in March to review its accounting practices.

The embattled state power utility’s debt burden, described by Goldman Sachs Group as the biggest threat to the nation’s economy, has burgeoned, compounding the difficulty the government faces in formulating a turnaround plan.  Eskom’s debt is approaching R500 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from public records, including bonds and issued loans, up from about R370 billion a year ago. While the utility declined to comment on the current number, its chief executive officer Phakamani Hadebe last month put total debt at about R450 billion.

President Cyril Ramaphosa announced plans earlier this year to split the company into three units to make it easier to manage, and the National Treasury allocated a R69 billion cash injection over the next three years in the February budget — a bailout that’s already been partly offset by the rising debt. The composition of the utility’s debt has also changed, with loans accounting for just more than half of its total burden, up from 40% a year ago. The switch to short-term financing hasn’t been smooth sailing — a loan agreed with China Development Bank failed to come through as scheduled earlier this year and Eskom had to take out an urgent R3 billion bridge loan from Absa Group to avoid a call on existing guarantees.

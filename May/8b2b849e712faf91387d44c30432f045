Kellogg Co. fell in premarket trading after posting sales that just missed projections last quarter, dragged down by continuing challenges with breakfast foods. The packaged-food giant reported revenue of $3.52 billion in the first quarter, shy of the $3.54 billion analysts had estimated. It also announced that finance chief Fareed Khan will leave on July 1 and be replaced by Amit Banati, currently president of of its Asia Pacific, Africa and Middle East division. Cereal sales have been on the decline for years, as the breakfast-food category has been getting increasingly competitive with on-the-go bars and restaurants making a bigger play for consumers. In North America, cereal net sales slipped 4% when excluding the impact of currency, the company said, citing issues related to the timing of shipments.  Kellogg shares fell as much as 6% in premarket trading before paring some of the losses. The stock had gained 4% this year through Wednesdayâ€™s close, trailing the advance in the S&P 500 Index.

Gains in South African assets Friday suggest investors like the picture emerging from election results. The rand advanced for a fourth day and yields on benchmark bonds saw their biggest drop in six weeks as the ruling African National Congress headed for a victory margin that will strengthen President Cyril Ramaphosa’s hand as he pursues reforms to revive a flagging economy. With 80% of the ballots counted, the ANC has about 57% of the national vote. A win of between 55% and 60% is expected to boost Ramaphosa’s position within the party and his ability to implement key changes.

Over the past year, the best way to make money was to be a Chinese bank. Or Apple. The Cupertino-based smartphone maker led the world for the fourth straight time with $57.2 billion in net income, based on the trailing 12 months through March. Industrial & Commercial Bank of China and China Construction Bank ranked next, aided by Beijing’s policy push to spur credit and beat back a deepening economic slowdown. For the first time in eight years, neither a drug maker nor a car company was among the top 15 moneymakers.

For others whose fiscal follows the calendar or oddballs such as Apple which start from October, the analysis crosses over into more than one financial year. With nine spots, financial services firms make up the biggest chunk of money-spinners in the list with US and China having a tally of four each. JPMorgan Chase & Co made the most money among American banks. Berkshire’s nightmare Berkshire Hathaway ranked 11th as it tackled a tweak in accounting rules, which its billionaire-founder has described as a “nightmare”. Warren Buffett’s investment firm would have barely made the Top 200 using the 2018 annual result, hurt by the new regulations that can, according to Buffett, significantly distort profit by including stock swings.

Medicine makers world over are struggling to fend off lawsuits, create a pipeline of patent-protected drugs or boost profits in the face of a bitter price war in non-patented drugs. Johnson & Johnson, the top performer in the sector, came in at number 27 over the period analysed. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P

Caterpillar announced its largest dividend payout on record, but investors may have been expecting more. The company’s shares fell as much as 1.5%. Prior to the start of its investor day, the heavy-equipment maker said it plans to increase the dividend in each of the following four years by “at least a high single-digit percentage.” With its remaining free cash flow, it intends to repurchase shares “on a more consistent basis,” the Deerfield, Illinois-based company said in a statement Thursday. “All in, the plan is much as we expected — evolutionary rather than revolutionary, in our view, although some expected a large one-time share repurchase that doesn’t appear to be happening,” Jefferies analysts led by Stephen Volkmann said in a note. Caterpillar shares fell 0.7% at 10:04 am in New York. The announcement comes about a week after the company first-quarter profit that beat estimates. Even with the better-than-expected results, shares of Caterpillar, an economic bellwether, slipped last week amid concern over the outlook for demand the rest of the year. Caterpillar said Thursday it’s also making a bet on services, expecting to double sales of machine, energy and transportation services by 2026 and delivering higher margins. The world’s largest maker of construction and mining equipment aims to boost adjusted operating margins by three to six percentage points above the historical performance in 2010 to 2016, as it expressed confidence in the company’s strategy to boost profit growth. “While this is certainly an improved performance, we would point out that Caterpillar is already at the high end of this new framework, suggesting either conservatism or little additional upside from here,” Volkmann said. “Caterpillar’s updated long-term guidance suggests a focus on boosting its service offerings, which may support operating-margin improvement.” – Karen Ubelhart, Americas industrials analyst

In a Sens announcement that was published after market close on Tuesday, Steinhoff International said it would still release its audited financial statements for the year ended December 2017 later on in the evening. “The company still aims to publish its audited 2017 financial statements later tonight. Once
released, the details will be available on the company’s website,” the Sens reads. <a href="https://iono.fm/e/685433">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> However, Steinhoff notes that should it find that it is not “achievable to release these results, a further announcement will be made later tonight”. This has created uncertainty as to whether the market will see an earnings report from Steinhoff ahead of local elections tomorrow. The audited financial statements for both 2017 and 2018 have suffered numerous delays as the company deals with the fallout from accounting fraud that was uncovered at the end of 2017. Steinhoff has advised shareholders in the company to exercise caution when dealing in shares in the group. Updates to follow. Read the full Sens announcement here.

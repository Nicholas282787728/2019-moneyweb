The US Supreme Court ruled that consumers can press ahead with a lawsuit that accuses Apple of using its market dominance to artificially inflate prices at its App Store. The 5-4 ruling could add to pressure the company faces to cut the 30% commission it charges on app sales. Lawyers pressing the case have said they will seek hundreds of millions of dollars on behalf of overpaying consumers. Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the courtâ€™s liberal wing in the majority. Apple dropped 5.5% to $186.45 at 10:15 am in New York.

The IEC indicated shortly before 5pm on Thursday that counting had been completed at more than 51% of the 22 925 voting districts, with the voter turnout percentage indicated earlier in the day no longer visible on the election results dashboard (it stood at 70% just after 11am and had dropped to 65.33% just before 4pm). While such a big sample would make any researcher happy to defend their findings, it does not apply to elections as results can differ widely from one voting district to the next. However, the results so far are worth noting. If they prove to be representative of SA as a whole, the governing ANC has lost some ground. Thus far, it has 56.8% support compared to 62% in 2014, while the DA increased its support from 22.23% to 22.81%.

The following table shows how representation in parliament can change if the voting patterns are similar in voting districts that still need to announce their results:

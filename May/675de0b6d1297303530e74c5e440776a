President Cyril Ramaphosa said the government won’t cut jobs at the state power utility, Eskom, as it divides the company into three separate businesses. Ramaphosa announced the plan to divide the company into generation, transmission and distribution units in February, and there was an immediate backlash from labor unions who are concerned that the plan could lead to job losses. Eskom has 47 000 workers, a figure the World Bank has said is 66% too high, and debt in excess of R430 billion.

The government agreed to give it a record R69 billion bailout in February. The company won’t cut power to consumers this winter, Ramaphosa said. South Africa’s winter runs from June until August. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P

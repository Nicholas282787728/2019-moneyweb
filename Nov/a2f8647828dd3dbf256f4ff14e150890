French oil and gas major Total said it will drill another exploration well in the 11B/12B block offshore South Africa in the first quarter of next year, a senior company official said on Tuesday. Earlier this year, Total opened up a new play off South Africa‘s southern coast, after making an offshore discovery that could contain 1 billion barrels of total resources while drilling its Brulpadda prospects in the Outeniqua Basin.

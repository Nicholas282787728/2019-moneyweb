Africa’s biggest pay-TV group MultiChoice said on Thursday it expects its core headline earnings per share (Heps) for the first half of the year to be between 20% and 25% higher than during the same period last year. The company, which was spun off by South African e-commerce giant Naspers in February, said its standard Heps and trading profit were also expected to rise thanks mostly to reduced losses in its businesses outside of South Africa.

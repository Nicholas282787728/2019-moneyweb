Not only did Sasol warn shareholders that they can expect headline earnings per share (Heps) to decline by at least 20%, it also warned that the results for the six months to December 2019 may be further affected by adjustments due to the closure of its books at the end of the reporting period. “This might result in a change in the estimated earnings. This trading statement only deals with the comparison to the prior period,” reads the trading update. “A more detailed trading statement will be published as soon as more certainty has been attained with respect to the range of the decrease in [Heps] and EPS [earnings per share].” Investors will immediately think of the possibility of more adjustments relating to Sasol’s huge Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP) – and indeed, Sasol does refer to it again. Management said that it pursued steps to enhance its liquidity position with debt expecting to reach a peak during 2020 with the final completion of the huge project. Sasol has taken a number of actions to fulfil its commitment to balance sheet flexibility, access to liquidity and maintaining an optimal funding mix, according to the latest statement. Sasol has reiterated that the LCCP will change the company totally. It is set to grow foreign earnings significantly, as well as increase the contribution by the chemical division to reduce the exposure to the mainly SA fuel-manufacturing businesses. Management also repeated the message that gearing will peak in 2020 in accordance with the original planning of the project, but will be somewhat higher than estimated. After final commissioning towards the third quarter of 2020, debt levels are expected to drop rapidly. While Sasol reassured shareholders in the trading statement that the latest funding activities should not affect its net debt position, management disclosed that lenders have agreed to relax the understanding that Sasol maintain its net debt to earnings before interest, tax and depreciation at three to 3.5 times until June 2020. This seems to indicate that operating profit is expected to take another hit during the six months to December, and also in the following six months. Shareholders did not seem fazed by the news and the share price on the day ended steady at around R280, up from its recent low of R252 at the beginning of October. A look at Sasol’s figures over the last few years shows that shareholders are well aware of the decline in profits since 2015, when work on the Lake Charles project started in all earnestness. Sasol since 2012 – selected financial indicators Total assets Debt Equity Debt/assets Net finance costs Profit Operating cash flow * * Cash retained from operating activities after interest, tax and dividends Source: Compiled from Sasol annual reports Sasol announced the feasibility study into the project in 2011 and took the final decision to proceed in 2014. The feasibility study and preliminary engineering designs for such a huge project would have been expensive, but capital expenditure only started to increase heavily from 2015 when the first yellow machines arrived on site. Debt increased to R127 billion at the end of the 2015 financial year, compared with the pre-LCCP levels of R69 billion in 2012. However, one should bear in mind that Sasol also spent capital on its other projects around the world, although LCCP was destined to become the biggest. When the building of the plant started to gain momentum in 2016 and 2017, debt increased even faster, to R178 billion in June 2016 and all the way to R244 billion by the end of June 2019. Debt compared to total assets increased from 35% in 2012 to 52% in 2019. Net finance costs increased as well, from a low of R705 million in 2014 to more than R2 billion in 2018, before easing to R1.55 billion in 2019. However, neither the large debt nor net interest paid seems to be the main concern now. The figures show that Sasol’s profits have declined steadily since the levels of above R30 billion posted in the 2014 and 2015 financial years. When Sasol announced its good results for the year to June 2014, the share price was sitting above R600, but had declined to R430 when it announced the excellent profit of R31 billion in September 2015. Admittedly, the JSE dropped by around 27% over the period. The Sasol share price fell to below R400 when profit halved to only R15 billion in 2016, before a rally took it close to R600 on the back of a significant increase in oil prices and an even more significant decrease in the value of the rand. After that, the share price more than halved to a low of around R250, as Sasol’s profit fell to only R6 billion in the year to June 2019. Shareholders are probably waiting anxiously for the half-year figures to December to see how Sasol performed and if new CEO Fleetwood Grobler, who took over in September, has cleaned house and paid some costs to effect changes.

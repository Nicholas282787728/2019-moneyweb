Despite a strained economic environment which has weighed on consumers, retailer Woolworths saw a growth in sales for the first 20 weeks to November 17, even as its Australian David Jones operations deteriorated. In a trading statement on Wednesday, the group said its sales had risen by 2.2%, with South African food sales growing by 8.8% and fashion, beauty and home sales up 2.8%. “The business has maintained positive volume growth and continues to grow market share. Net space growth was 3.6%.” Meanwhile, in Australia, David Jones sales in the same period declined by 2.1%, with refurbishments at the retailer’s flagship store on Elizabeth Street – that are set for completion in March 2020 – reportedly contributing to the decline. Comparable store sales which include online were 0.7% lower; Country Road group sales declined by 4.7%, impacted by its planned exit from Australia’s largest department store, Myer. David Jones has troubled the company since the upmarket brand was acquired in 2014. Woolworths has recently written down the value of David Jones by R4.4 billion or $437 million (Australian dollars) after a R7.1 billion (A$712 million) value reduction in January 2018. This leaves the total value of the business, which was acquired at R21.5 billion(A$2.1 billion), at just under R10 billion (A$1 billion).

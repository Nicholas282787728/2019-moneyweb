China said on Thursday that it had agreed with the United States to remove tariffs in phases, while the state-owned Xinhua News Agency said Beijing was also considering removing restrictions on poultry imports. “This is fuelling optimism that a trade deal will be solidified at some point,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. “It removes a veil of uncertainty and gives the market a green light for a risk-on path.” Trade-sensitive industrials 3M Co and Caterpillar Inc rose over 1% in premarket trading.

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari ruled out the possibility of changing the constitution to seek a third term in office, Punch newspaper reported. The head of state, 76, was re-elected in March for a second four year mandate, the last he is permitted under the west African country’s constitution. Speculation is already turning to who the ruling All Progressives Congress and opposition People’s Democratic Party will nominate to fight the 2023 contest. “I’m not going to make the mistake of attempting a third term,” Buhari said Friday at a meeting of his party, Punch reported. “Besides the age, the constitution makes provision for only two terms.” Nigeria’s rules also make it difficult to modify the constitution. Any amendment would need the votes of two-thirds of both chambers of parliament, as well as an approval by the House of Assembly in at least 24 of the country’s 36 states. Buhari said on Thursday that the current constitution delays the passing of laws of the Senate and House of Representatives and could be “altered to reflect some dynamics and realities of the country,” according to a statement emailed by his spokesman Femi Adesina. “I try as much as I can to always be loyal and obedient to the constitution so long as it is humanly possible,” he said.

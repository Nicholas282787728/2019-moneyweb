Sasol, South Africa’s second-biggest producer of greenhouse gases after Eskom, pledged more clarity on plans to reduce its impact on the environment. The company, which together with Eskom also produces pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and particulate emissions, said its long-term strategy will be released next year. Sasol has already pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 10% by 2030 in its inaugural climate-change report released this year. The company will lay out plans to use more natural gas, rather than coal, in its operations, as well as so-called green hydrogen, which is produced from renewable energy sources, chief executive officer Fleetwood Grobler said at the company’s annual general meeting. Sasol is coming under pressure from environmental activists and investors to improve its performance on climate matters. The company refused to put resolutions demanding more clarity on its strategy to shareholders and activists gathered outside the meeting in northern Johannesburg.

South African Airways (SAA) has extended the cancellation of all domestic and regional flights to Monday, it said, as a majority of its employees went on strike on Friday. The state airline said it was aiming to operate most of its international flights departing from Johannesburgâ€™s O.R. Tambo International Airport from Sunday. It said inbound flights from London, New York, Washington, Munich, Frankfurt and Hong Kong were set to operate from Monday.

Mediclinic International reported a 4% rise in half-year core earnings on Thursday as the company’s Swiss business adjusted to regulatory changes and its South African and Middle Eastern operations performed well. The private healthcare group, listed in London and Johannesburg, said it made earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) of 222 million pounds ($284 million), up 4% from 213 million pounds a year earlier.

Revenue at the company’s Middle Eastern unit rose by 8%, helped by the ramp-up of Mediclinic Parkview Hospital in Dubai and a gradual improvement in its Abu Dhabi business. Hirslanden, the Swiss business that accounts for 47% of group revenue, grew revenue by 5%. The division had been hurt by regulatory changes, including tariff reductions for outpatients and a less favourable insurance mix. Insurance mix refers to the different types of insured patients, with some on full cover and some on semi-cover, which are usually lower margin. The changes had pushed Mediclinic’s earnings down by 4% in the year to the end of March 2019. Mediclinic, founded in South Africa in 1983, runs 78 hospitals, five sub-acute hospitals, 13 day case clinics and 22 outpatient clinics.

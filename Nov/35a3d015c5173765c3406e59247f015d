The National Empowerment Fund (NEF), one of the many state-owned entities in control of large amounts of money, sees itself at the epicentre of “a continuous and gradually widening coil which spirals into a galaxy of opportunities”. Read: Growth in alternative funding models for smaller businesses It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC), which is imbued with the “spirit of khawuleza” (‘responsiveness’) and aims to address the “structures in the economy which impede growth, economic inclusion and job creation”. The NEF falls under the Department of Trade and Industry (dti). Minister of Trade and Industry Ebrahim Patel outlined the focus areas of the dti: to support improved industrial performance, dynamism and competitiveness of local companies, improve the levels of fixed investment in the economy and capability of the state, expand markets for SA products and facilitate entry to those markets, and promote economic inclusion and equitable spatial and industrial development.

The internal financial control systems were given a clean bill of health, and there was no irregular expenditure. The NEF has a negative cash flow trend, resulting in the reduction of “cash and cash equivalents” from R1.5 billion in 2015 to R1 billion in 2019. The NEF has also been making losses for at least the last five years, reducing the surplus from R3.3 billion to R1.7 billion. Administration charges are above 50% of revenue. Included in income is “enterprise funding” amounting to R123 million, which was received over three years from 2015 to 2017.

The bulk of professional fees comprise legal fees of R15.3 million (2018: R16.4 million) and investment advice of R3.1 million (2018: R3.4 million). The dti should rein in its expenses and concentrate on providing economic and financial support to start-up businesses that have a chance of making profits and creating employment. A business model that includes funding “boutique hotels”, and purchasing failing businesses in order to save the loss of jobs will continue to erode the assets. The NEF should note its increasing impairment charges and fair value losses. It is not too big to fail.

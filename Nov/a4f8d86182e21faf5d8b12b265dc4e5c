The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) is sliding down a bottomless pit, with no end in sight. The 2019 annual report indicates that the national broadcaster has not escaped maladministration and internal corruption, and is faced with ongoing funding challenges. Read: SABC reportedly needs R3.2bn government backing to avoid shutdown More government handouts An amount of R3.2 billion, payable from the government contingency reserve, has been allocated to the SABC. It will be paid over by National Treasury in tranches. This lifesaver enabled the annual report to be published, and saved the SABC from trading as an insolvent entity. But this won’t be enough. Read: SABC to get first tranche of bailout Directors and key management Its non-executive directors, executive directors, and senior management don’t come cheap.  2019 2018 Non-executive directors (11/12) R3 871 000 R7 210 000 Executive directors (5/7) R13 825 000 R9 900 000 Senior management (15/21) R24 792 000 R28 397 000  R42 488 000 R45 507 000 Group executive of commercial enterprises Tshifhiwa Mulaudzi, who was suspended in April, earned a commission of R421 000 (2018: R345 000). The SABC board comprises 12 non-executive directors and three executive directors. Many of the 12 non-executive directors sit on various boards, convocations, councils, trusts, and so on. It may be worth this state-owned entity (SOE), that is struggling to make ends meet and runs out of cash to pay salaries to workers, to consider cutting down on the number of directors and executives it has. Report of the Auditor-General (AG) The AG issued a qualified report with findings, including: In a nutshell, the SABC is insolvent. A deferred tax asset of R582.8 million has not been raised as the entity is unlikely to generate any taxable income in the foreseeable future. The liabilities exceed the assets It is to be noted that the SABC defined benefit pension fund is included in the assets The total liabilities exceed the total assets by R594.4 million (2018: R174.1 million), and the current liabilities exceed the current assets by R875.1 million (2018: R456 million) R’000 2019 2018 Total assets R5 292 773 R4 216 766 Less: defined benefit fund asset -R2 049 940 -R852 872 Assets without defined benefit fund R3 242 833 R3 363 894 Less: Total liabilities -R3 837 205 -R3 537 977 Excess total liabilities over total assets -R594 372 -R174 083 Current assets R1 573 214 R1 626 578 Current liabilities -R2 448 285 -R2 082 570 Excess current liabilities over current assets -R875 071 -R455 992 The total cost of employment (all staff), excluding long service awards, defined benefit pension payments, leave pay and post-retirement medical benefits, comes to R2.4 billion (2018: R2.7 billion). Can the SABC be fixed? Treasury carried out a review in August 2019, and laid down set conditions that the SABC has to comply with in order to receive part of the R3.2 billion amount that has been allocated: “Therefore, there is a material uncertainty as to the timing and quantum of funding tranches to be received from National Treasury.” Irregular expenditure in 2019 amounted to a whopping R5.2 billion. An amount of R5 billion was carried over from 2018. The irregular expenditure exceeds the bailout. Contingent liabilities amount to R1.4 billion. Various strategies have been proposed. This includes the appointment of a chief restructuring officer, which will no doubt come at a huge cost. Strategies include: Management is of the view that the SABC is a “strategic asset of the public sector/government”. As Treasury is in control of the purse strings, the SABC should be moved from being under the control of the Department of Communications to Treasury. Employees’ pension fund monies are safely protected by the pension funds. Be that as it may, shouldn’t Treasury consider the feasibility of moving all defined benefit pension funds under the control of the various SOEs to the GEPF? In reviewing these financials, it is difficult not to feel tremendous sympathy for the talented, hard-working SABC employees.

Botswana plans to issue commercial elephant-hunting quotes by December, President Mokgweetsi Masisi said. The commercial hunting season will start in April, Masisi told lawmakers in his state-of-the-nation address Monday in the capital, Gaborone. “The lessons we learnt when we banned hunting in 2014 is that the community must be empowered and not isolated in hunting,” he said.

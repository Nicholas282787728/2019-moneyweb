Prosus, the technology investment company that owns a large stake in China’s Tencent, said on Monday that it expects a rise of between 3% and 9% in “core headline earnings per share” from continuing operations for its fiscal first half year ended September 30. Dutch-based Prosus was spun out South Africa’s Naspers in a September 11 initial public offering, and Naspers retains a 73.8% stake. Prosus said it was releasing half-year figures on Monday ahead of its official earnings due on November 22. The non-standard “core headline earnings per share” figure excludes one-off gains from the sale of operations in both years, as well as some other non-operating items including the issue of shares to executives as payment, Prosus said in its trading update.

Toshiba is set to post a seven-fold increase from a year earlier in April-September operating profit, the Nikkei reported Sunday, without saying where it got the information. Despite the 50 billion yen ($458 million) in operating profit in the six-month period, the company will report a net loss because of the weak performance of a chip-making subsidiary and deficits in its LNG business, the newspaper said. Toshiba is due to release half-year results on November 13. Â© 2019 Bloomberg L.P.

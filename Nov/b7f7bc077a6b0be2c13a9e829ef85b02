The Development Bank of SA (DBSA) has funded development loans granted to external parties with debt. To be specific, 67.2% (2018: 71.3%) of the net development loans granted (after impairment) have been funded with debt. DBSA’s total debt liability amounts to R51 billion (2018: R53.5 billion). In my view, the DBSA will have to continue to raise new debt in order to fund its liabilities. The cash flow statement illustrates its reliance on raising new debt.

Total comprehensive income for the year is R3.1 billion (2018: R2.3 billion). This represents a 3.4% return on the total assets (2018: 2.6%). The permanent government funding (treated as equity hence no interest or repayments) is R11.7 billion (R11.7 billion). The biggest risk is that the DBSA is burdened with debt: R’000 2019 2018 IFRS 9 IAS 39 Debt funding (FVPL) * 6 469 451 6 473 055 Debt funding held at amortised cost 44 516 190 33 363 703 Lines of credit 13 677 213 50 985 641 53 513 971 Total assets 89 488 409 89 211 946 Debt funding as a % of total assets 56.97% 59.99% * Fair value through profit and loss Interest payments were R3.8 billion (R3.6 billion). It is unlikely that the DBSA will be able to start weaning itself off raising new debt in the foreseeable future. Investments The DBSA aspires to “building Africa’s prosperity” and has a “footprint across much of sub-Saharan Africa”, with “developmental partnerships spanning the globe”. Keeping this up requires sustainability. The DBSA has provided the following funding to external parties: 1. Development loans Development loans granted amount to R82 billion (2018: R79.9 billion). This represents 91.65% of the total assets (2018: 89.53%). The provision for expected credit losses is R6.2 billion (2018: R4.8 billion). The provision constitutes 6.92% of total assets (2018: 5.41%).

Interest received per the cash flow statement is R8.2 billion (R7.5 billion). Gauteng received R36.7 billion (2018: R37.6 billion) and the rest of Africa received R20.6 billion (2018: R17 billion), while R47.4 billion (2018: R46.7 billion) went into energy, and R12.4 billion went into roads and drainage. The ECL has not been disclosed. 2. Investment securities The DBSA holds R1.9 billion in bonds (2018: R1.4 billion). It earned interest of R38.2 million (2018: R41.3 million). In other words, the rate of return was 2.03% (2018: 2.91%). 3. Equity investments The DBSA holds R5.9 billion in equity investments (2018: R5.5 billion).

This should be a given, not a cause for celebration. An unqualified audit report does not constitute a forensic report, nor a gold star for excellent financial management. If the government is going to be serious about reining in rampant expenditure in state-owned entities (SOEs) and stopping the bleed, it should learn something about governance and control. As South Africa’s total debt-to-GDP ratio edges towards 70%, government should be concerned that one of its major SOEs is reliant on raising new debt to cover its liabilities. Finance Minister Tito Mboweni spoke of SOEs becoming self-reliant, and cutting down on expenditure. Perhaps we can all learn something from how he implements this in the DBSA.

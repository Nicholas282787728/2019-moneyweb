Qantas Airways flew non-stop to Sydney from London in about 19 1/2 hours, a test run for the world’s longest commercial service. The Boeing Dreamliner touched down after 19 hours and 19 minutes in the air, Qantas said Friday. Its direct New York-Sydney flight last month — a first by any airline — was 3 minutes shorter. Qantas is preparing for commercial services on both routes as soon as 2022, and used the trips to investigate ways to reduce passenger jet lag and manage crew fatigue.

Qantas’s third and final research flight leaves New York for Sydney in December. Before starting the ultra long-haul services, which Qantas calls Project Sunrise, the airline needs new aircraft that can carry a full payload. The airline also requires fresh accords with its pilots and Australia’s aviation regulator. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P.

A strike at South African Airways, which has dragged on since November 15 and grounded a number of flights, is likely to end on Friday, with workers having agreed “in principle” to a pay deal, a senior union official said. The deal will see workers get a 5.9% pay increase, with a further increment — details of which are still being worked out – being paid at a later date, Christopher Shabangu, deputy president of the South African Cabin Crew Association, said. The association and the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa, which represent more than 3 000 SAA workers, plan to hold a media briefing later on Friday, where they will reveal more details of the terms of the pay offer. SAA spokesman Tlali Tlali didn’t answer calls to his mobile phone.

South Africa dodged its third junk rating late Friday — something markets had been counting on for months — as Moody’s Investors Service maintained the nation’s lowest investment grade score. Read: Moody’s leaves South Africa teetering on brink of ‘junk’ Investors and analysts had been expecting Moody’s to join S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings in dropping the nation’s debt to non-investment grade. The move would have been “a long time coming” as South African data suggested a deteriorating rating for some time, Peter Kinsella, global head of FX strategy for Union Bancaire Privee, said on Bloomberg TV in London. Instead, Moody’s just revised its outlook for the nation to negative from stable. The South African rand has tumbled nearly 4% over the past six months, the fourth-most in the developing world. Strategists at Bank of New York Mellon Corp. had warned that a downgrade would have removed the country from the FTSE World Government Bond Index, spurring up to $15 billion in outflows. “I think there will be some turbulence in the short term and more downward pressure on the rand,” said John Ashbourne, London-based senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics. “There is no way to pretend that this isn’t bad news.” In fact, traders were already bracing for wild swings in the rand after the scheduled review. The spread of one-week implied volatility for the rand versus the dollar over the three-month measure moved to its widest since March on Thursday.

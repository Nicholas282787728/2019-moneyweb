Increasingly investors are realising that the only variables that can be controlled when investing are the fees that you pay, whereas equity market performance turns out to be pretty random, and certainly unpredictable. Equity funds that outperform today were probably yesterday’s poor performers … and where they’ll land up tomorrow is in the lap of the Gods. Our research leads us to believe that the majority of funds that beat the market do so purely as a result of luck rather than skill. But leaving the arguments of picking funds aside, is there any way to save on fees while maximising returns? The short answer: Yes. The unit trust general equity sector currently has R282 billion in assets under management (AUM). Of this R262 billion has a three-year track record (in 139 funds). During this time the market returned 5.07% per annum. Three-year comparison – Market return: 5.07%  Totals Funds underperforming the market Funds outperforming the market Number of funds 139 118 21 Assets under management R262bn R250bn R12bn Average total expense ratio 1.34% 1.4% 0.99% TER paid in rands R3 693m R3 592m R101m Source: Financial Express Analytics / Profile Media data (30 September 2016 – 30 September 2019) Let’s assume the numbers in the above table were stable throughout those three years: Looking at five-year returns the results are not much different: Five-year comparison – Market return 5.32%  Totals Funds underperforming the market Funds outperforming the market Number of funds 107 92 15 Assets under management R213bn R192bn R21bn Average TER 1.38% 1.39% 1.32% TER paid inrRands R3 116m R2 740m R376m Source: Financial Express Analytics / Profile Media data (30 September 2014 – 30 September 2019) Another way of looking at this is to plot each fund’s total expense ratio (TER) against the three-year return: From the equation it appears that by paying a higher TER (vertical axis) you can expect to earn a lower return (horizontal axis) and vice versa. By taking the ten funds with the lowest TERS available in the market, we managed to outperform the ten most expensive funds on a three-year basis: Three-year comparison Market return 5.07% 10 cheapest funds 10 most expensive funds Average TER 0.4% 2.2% Assets under management R6bn R17bn Average 3-year return 4.32% 3.42% TER in Rands R24m R388m Source: Financial Express Analytics / Profile Media data (30 September 2016 – 30 September 2019) All ten of cheapest funds were based on some form of indexation or followed a passive approach to investing. Had investors used the cheapest options available, they would’ve earned R153 million (R17 000 * 0.9%) more in performance and/or saved R306 million (R17 000 * [2.2%-0.4%]) in TER alone. Bear in mind that we have focused only on TER’s; if we had worked with Total Investment Charges (TIC) the costs would’ve been even more widely spread: generally speaking, active funds pay more in transaction costs which impacts the TIC’s. A similar trend can be seen if you look at the data over a five year period: Five-year comparison Market return 5.32% 10 cheapest funds 10 most expensive funds Average TER 0.45% 2.16% Assets under management R5bn R17bn Average three-year return 4.33% 4.03% TER in rands R22m R388m Source: Financial Express Analytics / Profile Media data (30 September 2014 – 30 September 2019) Are investors getting value for money when 95% of total fund expenses in the general equity space goes to the lower performing funds? And the flip side to this question is if lower priced funds perform better than expensive ones, why are the ten lowest priced funds only holding 2% (three-year data) of the retail assets under management? Final thought: ‘If you do not change direction, you may end up where you are heading.’ ~Lao Tzu Casparus Treurnicht is a portfolio manager.

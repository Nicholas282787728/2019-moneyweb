Former South African Reserve Bank deputy governor Daniel Mminele will be appointed chief executive of Absa, the BusinessDay newspaper reported on Wednesday citing anonymous sources. A spokeswoman for the financial services firm did not respond to Reuters requests for immediate comment. Long-time Absa boss Maria Ramos retired earlier this year and the bank said in August it had completed a selection process for a successor.

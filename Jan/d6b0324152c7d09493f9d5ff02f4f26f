Looking ahead in 2019 The new year seems to be a promising one in terms of political events and economic development. The May elections will be pivotal to the process, with the ANC going ahead with preparations for its manifesto. Other aspects to watch out for in 2019 are the process of land expropriation without compensation, development in the property sector and perhaps stricter governance within South Africa’s parastatals. 5. Rand update A boost from emerging markets helped the rand strengthen on Friday. On Monday the rand reached the R13 mark, sitting at R13.96 at 8:37.

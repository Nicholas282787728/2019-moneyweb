South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said that after meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi the two countries had entered into a three-year cooperation agreement. “While trade has increased significantly over the last few years, and India is currently our second-largest trading partner in Asia, there are a number of areas of future cooperation,” Ramaphosa said in an emailed statement on Friday. “These include agro-processed goods, defense procurement, mining equipment and technology and cooperation in the financial services sector.”

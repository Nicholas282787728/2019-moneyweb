South African ports and rail operator Transnet is working to recover funds lost through corruption that left the company looking like a “horror movie,” Chairman Popo Molefe said. A forensic probe into Transnet and the state power utility last year found some executives and board members failed to act in the companies’ best interests and recommended criminal investigations. The inquiry examined the extent of so-called state capture, where private individuals used influence over government officials to win contracts from state companies. A new board appointed in May is overhauling the organization, Molefe told reporters Thursday in Johannesburg. “What we found in the organisation was nothing short of a horror movie,” Molefe said. “State capture turned Transnet into a piggy bank for some.” © 2019 Bloomberg L.P

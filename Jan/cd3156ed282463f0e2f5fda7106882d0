General Electric Co. jumped as its new boss pushed ahead in tackling two of the biggest concerns hanging over the company: its heavy debt load and a US investigation into the company’s old subprime lender. GE reached an agreement in principle with the Justice Department to pay a $1.5 billion civil penalty to settle of an investigation into the lender, WMC. That’s in line with the company’s prior reserve for the matter, GE said in a statement Thursday. Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp emphasized his goal of reducing indebtedness, saying, “Our strategy is clear: deleverage our balance sheet and strengthen our businesses, starting with Power.” The Power business’s 25% sales drop served as a reminder of the depth of GE’s challenges in one of its marquee divisions.  GE jumped 6.6% to $9.70 ahead of regular trading in New York. The shares advanced 20% this year through Wednesday, compared with an 11% gain for a Standard & Poor’s index of industrial companies. GE tumbled 57% last year. Earnings of 17 cents a share in the fourth quarter missed the 22-cent average of analyst estimates. Sales rose 5.3% to $33.3 billion, exceeding expectations of $32.3 billion. Additional details Company presentation and supplemental information

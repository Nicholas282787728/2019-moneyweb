Vodafone Group narrowly missed a consensus analyst forecast for third-quarter revenue after competition in southern Europe continued to bite and it cut prices in South Africa, sending its shares down as much as 2.7%. Service revenue fell 3.9% to 9.79 billion euros ($11.1 billion) in the three months to December 31, narrowly below the average analyst forecast of 9.82 billion euros in a company-compiled survey. Organic service revenue rose 0.1%.

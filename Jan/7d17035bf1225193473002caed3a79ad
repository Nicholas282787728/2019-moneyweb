The S&P 500 jumped to a three-week high on Tuesday, led by Apple, Amazon, Facebook and industrial shares on bets that the United States and China would strike a deal to end their trade war. The three-day rally kicked off on Friday following robust US jobs data and dovish comments on interest rates by Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell has lifted the S&P 500 by over 9% from 20-month lows touched around Christmas.

The United States and China will extend trade talks in Beijing for an unscheduled third day, a member of the US delegation said, as the world’s two largest economies looked to resolve their bitter trade dispute.

Adding to the woes, Goldman Sachs forecast a tough year for chipmakers, particularly in the first half. Other investors remained upbeat about upcoming US quarterly results. “It’s the new year and investors are really stepping back and taking a look at the fundamentals, and realizing it’s not as bad a story as maybe we thought toward the end of the year,” said Jeff Kravetz, a regional investment strategist at US Bank Wealth Management.

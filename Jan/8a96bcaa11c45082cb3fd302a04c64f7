Zambian President Edgar Lungu is traveling to South Africa on Tuesday for an “urgent consultative meeting” with President Cyril Ramaphosa about Democratic Republic of Congo’s presidential election, the Zambian presidency said in a statement. Congo is awaiting delayed results from the December 30 poll, which is meant to lead to the Central African country’s first democratic transfer of power in its 59 years of independence but which opposition members say was marred by fraud.

South African consumer confidence held steady in the fourth quarter as a net majority of respondents in a survey anticipate an improvement in household finances. The consumer-confidence index was 7 in the last three months of 2018, matching the reading in the prior quarter, FirstRand’s First National Bank retail-lending unit said in an emailed statement Thursday. The survey suggests “most consumers are fairly optimistic that the outlook for the South African economy and their own household finances will improve during the next 12 months,” it said. “Confidence remains far higher compared to the depressed levels recorded between 2015 and 2017.” © 2019 Bloomberg L.P

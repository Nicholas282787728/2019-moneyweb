Netcare plans to cut as many as 500 jobs as it seeks to reduce costs after a failed expansion plan in the UK, according to Johannesburg-based Business Times. While the South African company won’t retrench any nurses, other positions will be reviewed, the newspaper cited Netcare employee relations manager Ramasela Mokonyama as saying. Netcare employs 20 000 people. After exiting the UK private hospital market last year, Netcare previously said it’s sticking to its “asset lighter” approach in a rapidly evolving industry. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P

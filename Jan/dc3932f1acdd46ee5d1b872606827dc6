In the tough investment environment of the last few years, it has been noticeable how a number of smaller asset managers in South Africa have been prominent in the performance tables. This was again confirmed at the Raging Bull Awards on Wednesday evening that recognised top-performing funds and managers over the last three and five years. Of the six Raging Bull Awards presented to South African funds, five went to unit trusts managed by smaller firms. The exception was the Sanlam Multi Managed Conservative Fund of Funds that won in the category for the best South African multi-asset equity fund on a risk-adjusted basis over five years. Most notably the Fairtree Equity Prescient Fund was awarded the title of the best South African equity general fund on a risk-adjusted basis for the second year running. This is a creditable achievement in a period when the local stock market has been extremely difficult to navigate. The list of Raging Bull Award winners is: Raging Bull Awards for straight performance over three years: Best South African equity general fund: RECM Equity Fund Best South African interest-bearing fund: Sasfin BCI Flexible Income Fund Best (South African-domiciled) global equity general fund: BlueAlpha BCI Global Equity Fund Best (FSCA-approved) offshore global equity fund: Contrarious Global Equity Fund Raging Bull Awards for risk-adjusted performance over five years: Best South African equity general fund: Fairtree Equity Prescient Fund Best South African multi-asset equity fund: Sanlam Multi Managed Conservative Fund of Funds Best South African multi-asset flexible fund: Long Beach Flexible Prescient Fund Best (FSCA-approved) offshore global asset allocation fund: Investec GSF Global Multi-Asset Income Fund Two smaller firms also gained recognition in the awards for South African manager of the year. These identify the companies with the best overall performance across their suite of funds. Boutique house MI-PLAN took third place, buoyed particularly by the performance of the MI-PLAN IP Global Macro Feeder Fund. This fund won a certificate for the top risk-adjusted performance by a South African-domiciled global multi-asset high equity fund over the past five years. PSG Asset Management took second place for the third year running. Although the company has gained significant recognition in recent years, it remains a relatively small player in the industry. The title of South African manager of the year went to Allan Gray. This was the third consecutive year that the countryâ€™s largest asset manager has earned this award. Nedgroup Investments took the award for the offshore management company of the year. This is the fourth year in a row that the company has claimed that accolade.

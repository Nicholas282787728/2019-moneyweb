McDonald’s reported a mixed bag in the fourth quarter: Global sales growth accelerated, but US sales were shy of estimates, showing the impact of steep discounts across the industry. Same-store sales rose 2.3% in the US, just short of the estimate for a 2.4% gain, according to Consensus Metrix. Globally, however, the measure topped projections — a sign the company’s international strategy is paying off. Shares initially fell in early trading after the report’s release, perhaps showing investors’ concern with US performance. Despite pushing forward with delivery, digital orders and remodeling stores to a more modern look, the company said its customer traffic was down in 2018 in the US.  The shares were little changed in early trading in New York. Through Tuesday’s close, McDonald’s had climbed 2.6% this year.

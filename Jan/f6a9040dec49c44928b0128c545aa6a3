Nigeria is to send a bill recommending a national minimum monthly wage of 27 000 naira ($88.15) to lawmakers in the national assembly, labour minister Chris Ngige said on Tuesday. Disagreements over the minimum wage saw labour unions striking across Nigeria in September. Labour unions want the minimum wage to be raised from 18 000 naira and the cost of living is a campaign issue ahead of a presidential election on February 16.

Zimbabwe’s biggest mobile phone operator Econet Wireless restored all internet and social media services on Monday after a court ruled the government’s shutdown of the internet last week was illegal, it said in a message to subscribers. The sporadic internet blackout, ordered by Security Minister Owen Ncube, began on Tuesday following the start of protests against a rise in fuel prices that turned violent.

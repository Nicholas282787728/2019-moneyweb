A rally in shares of chipmakers and airlines lifted the Nasdaq on Thursday, while the Dow Jones industrials and the S&P 500 wavered due to concerns about the Sino-US trade dispute and the longest US government shutdown ever. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the United States and China were a long way from resolving their trade dispute, but saw a fair chance of a deal. The two countries are trying to meet a March 1 deadline to resolve the dispute, which has roiled market for most of the past year. Despite the news, chip stocks powered higher on the back of upbeat quarterly results. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index , which had underperformed 10 of the 11 S&P sectors so far this year, jumped 5.78%. Xilinx Inc shares surged 17.5% and Lam Research jumped 14.6% after reporting better-than-expected results. Apple supplier Texas Instruments Inc rose 6.3% after what analysts called better-than-feared results. The company however warned of weak demand in China, a key market for many chipmakers. “Earnings so far have been a positive for markets,” said Chris Larkin, senior vice president of trading at E-Trade Financial in New Jersey. “But trade talks and the government shutdown are things that certainly impact markets. People react but no one actually knows what is going on and that in turn increases the volatility.” Adding to the cautious tone, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi acknowledged that economic growth in the euro zone was likely to be weaker than what was earlier expected due to the fallout from factors, including China’s slowdown.

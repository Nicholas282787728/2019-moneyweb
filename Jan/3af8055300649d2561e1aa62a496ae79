The notion of prescribed assets – and the possible use of retirement savings to drive inclusive growth and transformation in the financial sector as outlined in the 2019-election manifesto of the ruling party – has resulted in renewed focus on this topic. Investors should remain objective on the issue and realise that the principle of using retirement savings to develop the country, both socially and economically, while driving returns for investors cannot be faulted. However, it is key to ensure that this is achieved without jeopardising the retirement savings of South Africans; acknowledging that at present the main concern is that the assets most likely to be prescribed are the struggling state-owned enterprises.

Creating the environment to foster savings through providing tax breaks and then scuppering the savings by forcing injudicious investments is self-defeating. Certain retirement funds are already allocating assets towards social and economic development projects due to their good long-term performance, diversification benefits relative to the main asset classes and their role in mitigating risks associated with social equality and climate change. Although it’s debatable what the appropriate level of investment in social and economic development should be, many retirement funds are already investing in infrastructure projects such as renewable energy low-cost housing, township and rural property developments, low-cost housing and schools.

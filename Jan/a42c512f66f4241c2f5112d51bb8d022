The judicial commission that’s investigating the alleged theft of taxpayer funds during former South African President Jacob Zuma’s tenure was adjourned until Friday after security concerns. Members of the panel were made aware of a “security situation” during the lunch break on Thursday, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, who heads the inquiry, told reporters. “Necessary measures must be taken,” said Zondo, who wouldn’t give further details. Earlier, Angelo Agrizzi, a former Bosasa executive, testified how the services company paid millions of rand in bribes to secure and retain security, catering and other contracts from the government and private businesses. Agrizzi said he has received death threats and the commission is providing him with protection. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P

Alibaba reported a 41% rise in quarterly revenue, after expansion into spheres from cloud computing to entertainment offset a slowing online retail business. Revenue at China’s biggest e-commerce company rose to 117.3 billion yuan ($17.5 billion) in the three months ended December. That compares with the 119.4 billion-yuan average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Adjusted earnings per share was 12.2 yuan compared with the 11.2 yuan projected. Alibaba drove revenue growth during its busiest quarter, a period that includes its annual Singles’ Day promotion, by improving marketing tools and personalized recommendations that spurred purchases. Growth also sprung from billionaire Jack Ma’s decision to take control of its main delivery network, a meals-on-demand service and video platform Youku. Those expansions however have thinned margins and shifted the company away from an asset-light model. “Alibaba is the dominant and most profitable leader in China e-commerce,” David Dai, an analyst at Bernstein, wrote in a report. “The general macroeconomic environment should improve in the second half of 2019 as the Chinese government introduces measures to stimulate the economy and U.S. China trade war stabilises.” Shares of Alibaba slid 1.3% to $156.88 in New York on Tuesday. The stock has gained 14.5% this year compared with a 6.3% gain for the NYSE Composite Index. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P

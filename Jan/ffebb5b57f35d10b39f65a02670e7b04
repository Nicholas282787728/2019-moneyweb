Former Mozambican Finance Minister Manuel Chang, whom the US has accused of accepting bribes in a $2 billion debt scandal, abandoned his application for bail in South Africa as both his home nation and American authorities ask for his extradition. Chang will remain in custody in South Africa until a hearing on February 5, Magistrate Sagra Subroyen said at a court near Johannesburg on Friday. The court will decide on that date which of two requests for extradition by Mozambique and the US will get preference, J.J. du Toit, the deputy director of public prosecutions, said in Johannesburg. Arguments will be heard under section 10 of South Africa’s Extradition Act. Chang has been detained in South Africa since December 29 on US Department of Justice charges. COPYRIGHT© 2019 Bloomberg L.P

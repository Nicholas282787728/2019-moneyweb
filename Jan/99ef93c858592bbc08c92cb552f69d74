Trading in Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies will soon be exposed to a good deal more scrutiny in Denmark. The country’s tax agency has won permission to start collecting information relating to the trade of crypto-currencies conducted via three exchanges between 2016 and 2018, according to a statement on the agency’s website on Monday. More specifically, the exchanges will need to provide information on names, addresses and personal tax numbers. The sharing of such information “will ensure that citizens who have traded crypto-currencies have paid the right tax,” the agency said. Information on transactions made by foreign citizens and companies will be exchanged with the respective countries’ authorities. The tax agency is currently in contact with the relevant exchanges, it said. “Without going too far, I think one can say that this is a big market that we need to look at more closely,” Karin Bergen, a director at the agency, said in the statement.

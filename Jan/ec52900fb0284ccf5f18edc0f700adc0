President Donald Trump said he will skip the annual gathering of global financial elites in the Swiss ski resort town of Davos later this month if the partial government shutdown isn’t resolved by then. “If the shutdown continues,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Thursday, “I won’t go.” The US delegation to the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Switzerland is to include Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and US Trade Secretary Robert Lighthizer, among other top administration officials. The partial US government shutdown is in its 20th day, with no sign of an agreement. Trump walked out of a White House meeting with congressional leaders on Wednesday, calling it a “waste of time.” The president wants Congress to approve $5.7 billion to help fulfill a campaign promise to build a wall along the US-Mexico border that he insists is necessary to stem illegal migration. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P

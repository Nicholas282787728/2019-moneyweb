MultiChoice Africa Group, which will list on the JSE next month, expects to pay executive chairman Imtiaz Patel R22.2 million for the year ended 31 March 2019, up from R19.7 million in the 2018 financial year. Patel is by far MultiChoice’s highest-paid executive, according to the group’s pre-listing statement, which was published after markets closed in Johannesburg on Monday. Naspers, which is unbundling its controlling stake in MultiChoice to shareholders, expects the pay-television operator to list on the JSE on 27 February.

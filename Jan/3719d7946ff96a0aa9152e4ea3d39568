The head of the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission and other officials resigned with immediate effect, the government said. Chairman Job Whabira and the other commissioners will step down on Thursday, Chief Secretary to the President and Cabinet Misheck Sibanda said in a statement handed to reporters in the capital, Harare. “All commissioners have gone on leave pending the finalisation of their terminal benefits,” Sibanda said, without providing a reason for their resignations. Zimbabwe is among the world’s 21 most corrupt countries, according to Transparency International, a Berlin-based anti-graft advocacy group.

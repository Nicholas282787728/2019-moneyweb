Tesla said on Wednesday it was optimistic it could make a first quarter profit and expected to generate a profit and positive free cash flow consistently beyond the first quarter as it ramps up production of its Model 3 sedan. The electric car maker reported a smaller fourth-quarter profit compared with the previous three months and said Model 3 production volume in California should reach 7 000 units per week by the end of the year. The company said it made a net profit of $139.5 million in the three months ended December 31, compared with a $311.5 million profit in the third quarter, when it benefited from regulatory credits. Shares of the company fell nearly 3% as Tesla missed analystsâ€™ expectations for quarterly profit. Excluding items, Tesla earned $1.93 per share. Analysts had expected a profit of $2.20 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Tesla also said its optimistic target was to achieve a very small GAAP net income in the first quarter. The company said, barring unexpected challenges with Gigafactory Shanghai, it was targeting annualised Model 3 output of more than 500 000 units sometime between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2020.

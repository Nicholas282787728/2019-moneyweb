A firm led by Adrian Wood, the former chief executive of South African telecoms giant MTN, has pulled out of its Nigerian telecoms venture 9mobile, two people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. Woodâ€™s departure, two months after the formal takeover of 9mobile, comes after disagreements with Nigerian shareholders, the two people said.

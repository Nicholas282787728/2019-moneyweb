Johnson & Johnson, the world’s largest maker of health-care products, predicted slower sales growth next year despite beating analysts’ expectations to close 2018. The company is the first major medical manufacturer to report earnings for the fourth quarter. Fourth-quarter sales were $20.4 billion, and adjusted earnings per share were $1.97, J&J said in a statement. That topped the $20.2 billion in sales and $1.95 a share of earnings analysts had predicted. Sales will grow slowly next year, J&J said, without detailing why. Overall revenue for the company’s drug, medical device and consumer operations will rise 0% to 1% in 2019, a potential warning for other health-care manufacturers. J&J is performing better abroad than in the US. The company’s pharmaceutical unit, which accounts for almost half of its revenue, saw 2.8% year-over-year growth in the US and 13.7% growth internationally in the fourth-quarter, excluding the effect of currency exchange rates.  The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company’s shares are down 11% in the last 12 months. For next year, J&J predicts adjusted earnings per share of $8.50 to $8.65, compared with the $8.61 average of analysts’ estimates.

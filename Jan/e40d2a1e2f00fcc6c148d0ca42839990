The Southern African Development Community (SADC) has called an emergency meeting on Thursday in Addis Ababa to discuss Democratic Republic of Congo’s disputed presidential election, an adviser to President Joseph Kabila told Reuters. Runner-up Martin Fayulu filed a fraud complaint with the country’s highest court on Saturday asking for a recount of the official results, which showed another opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi winning with 38% of the vote. SADC called on Sunday for a recount but two key members of the regional bloc, South Africa and Zambia, backtracked on Monday and said they would not push for a recount.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday urged regional and international parties to refrain from speculation about the presidential vote result in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Democratic Republic of Congo’s electoral commission on Thursday declared opposition leader Tshisekedi the winner of last month’s chaotic presidential election, but the runner-up dismissed the outcome as an “electoral coup”.

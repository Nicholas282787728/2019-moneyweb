South African maize farmers are projected to have planted less hectares of the staple crop this season due to lower rainfall and warmer temperatures, the government’s Crop Estimates Committee (CEC) said on Tuesday. Farmers are estimated to have planted 2.269 million hectares of maize in the 2018/19 farming season, 2% lower compared to the 2.319 million hectares planted last season. The CEC estimates 1.257 million hectares of white maize, used for human consumption, and 1.012 million hectares of yellow maize used mainly in animal feed to have been planted. The governments estimate is 14% more than a Reuters poll of five traders and analysts that pegged the area planted at 1.998 million hectares. South Africa’s maize prices have climbed amid concerns that dry conditions in the main part of the country’s maize belt have delayed crop plantings outside the optimum planting window, threatening yields for the staple food that is also used in livestock feed. The white maize futures contract due in March closed up 0.62% to R2 755 on Tuesday, just below a near two-year high of 2 820 reached earlier this month, while yellow maize futures due in March closed at R3 048.

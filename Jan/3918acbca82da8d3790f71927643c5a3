South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and his Zambian counterpart Edgar Lungu on Wednesday urged the Democratic Republic Congo’s electoral commission to speedily release the result of the presidential vote to maintain stability. Congo is awaiting delayed results from the December 30 poll, which is meant to lead to the central African country’s first democratic transfer of power. Opposition members say the vote was marred by fraud.

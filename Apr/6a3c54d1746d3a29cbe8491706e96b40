After powering Hong Kong’s equity benchmark into a bull market, Tencent Holdings stood out as the only bright spot in the city on Thursday. The Internet giant rose as much as 3%, briefly trading above HK$400 for the first time in 10 months, after winning regulatory approval for one of its mobile games in China. It was one of the only two gainers on the Hang Seng Index, which fell 0.9% at the midday break. The shares are now approaching HK$405 — the price at which a major shareholder cut its stake last year that then triggered a wave of selling in the stock.  Sentiment over Tencent had been improving after its first licenses to operate new games in China, and amid optimism over new businesses. The rally has seen the stock outperform the Hang Seng Index by the most since July and just 5.4% short of analysts’ price targets. After plunging 23% last year on a run of bad news including a rare profit decline and a regulatory crackdown on gaming, brokerages had trimmed their 12-month price forecasts.

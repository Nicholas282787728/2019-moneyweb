The South African government’s support for a political movement some 4 500 miles away could complicate a R15.5 billion deal. Moroccan billionaire Othman Benjelloun on Tuesday spoke out against South Africa-based Sanlam’s acquisition of insurer Saham Finances SA, saying South Africa has chosen the wrong side in a territorial dispute. South Africa supports a group called the Polisario Front, which has been seeking self determination in the Western Sahara territory since 1991. Morocco also claims ownership of that sparsely populated desert region.

The insurer is seeking more acquisitions to cement its position as the continent’s largest financial-services firm outside of banking. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P

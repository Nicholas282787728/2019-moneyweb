Vodafone Group is sticking to its timeline for completing a $20.6 billion takeover of Liberty Global’s cable assets in eastern Europe and Germany after European regulators issued a so-called statement of objections cataloging concerns about the deal. “We still expect to receive final approval in the middle of this year,” Vodafone said in an emailed statement. The company will review the statement of objections “and continue our constructive dialog” with the European Commission, it said. The EU statement lays out potential antitrust concerns with the deal that the company can challenge in writing or at a hearing. Problems can be tackled by making an offer, usually the sale of a unit or changes to business behavior. The EU currently has a June 3 deadline to rule on the deal, which can be extended. The acquisition would help Vodafone bundle internet, phone and TV services in Germany, its biggest market, in a challenge to former monopoly Deutsche Telekom. Regulators said last year they were concerned that merging Vodafone with Liberty’s Unitymedia cable internet business would reduce the number of providers and eliminate competition. Vodafone shares were down 0.4% at 141.34 pence at 1:21 pm in London while the UK’s benchmark FTSE 100 Index advanced 1.1%.

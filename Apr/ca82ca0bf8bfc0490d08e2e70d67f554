Egyptian authorities announced a nationwide state of emergency for three months and imposed a curfew in parts of northern Sinai close to Israel and Gaza, according to a decree published in the official gazette. There was no immediate explanation for the decision but Egypt has imposed a state of emergency in northern Sinai in recent years to combat Islamist militants. Before the 2011 uprising that ousted President Hosni Mubarak, Egypt had long stretches of emergency rule.

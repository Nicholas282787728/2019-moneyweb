Support for South Africa’s ruling African National Congress has declined in the run-up to May 8 elections, placing its absolute majority at risk, a new opinion poll shows. The poll of 2 375 registered voters conducted this month by the South African Institute of Race Relations showed the ANC would win 51% backing based on a 72% voter turnout, down 5.2 percentage points since a February survey. The latest poll showed the Democratic Alliance winning 24% of the vote and the Economic Freedom Fighters 14%, the Johannesburg-based institute said. Another poll of 3 600 adults, who were interviewed face-to-face by research company Ipsos between March 22 and April 17, showed the ANC is likely to secure 61% support based on a 71% voter turnout, while the DA would get 19% and the EFF 11%. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P

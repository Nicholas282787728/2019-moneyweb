Flooding linked to Cyclone Idai, which lashed southeast Africa last month, could reduce Malawi’s staple maize crop by around 20% this farming season, Agriculture Minister Joseph Mwanamvekha said on Tuesday.

Before the cyclone struck, Malawi had hoped to produce 3.3 million metric tonnes in the 2018/19 farming season.

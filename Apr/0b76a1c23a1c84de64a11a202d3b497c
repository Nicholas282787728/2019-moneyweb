South Africa’s ruling African National Congress remains on course to dominate its sixth straight national election on May 8, an opinion poll released Monday shows. The poll of 3 600 adults, who were interviewed face-to-face by research company Ipsos between March 22 and April 17, showed the ANC is likely to secure 61% support based on a 71% voter turnout, while the Democratic Alliance would get 19% and the Economic Freedom Fighters 11%. No other party polled more than 2% support. The survey results are broadly in line with Ipsos’s last poll of 2 835 adults who were interviewed between February 1 and March 4. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P

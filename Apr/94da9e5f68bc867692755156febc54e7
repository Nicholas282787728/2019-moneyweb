Hasbro soared as much as 17% after reporting an unexpected gain in first-quarter sales — more evidence that the toymaker is recovering from the loss of major customer Toys ‘R’ Us. Revenue for the world’s largest publicly traded toymaker rose 2% to $732.5 million, gaining for the first quarter in six and topping analysts’ average estimate. Hasbro’s first quarter, which runs through March, is its smallest in terms of revenue. However, investors were keen to see if the company could back up its claim that the disruption caused by the liquidation of Toys “R” Us in early 2018 would dissipate this year. In that sense, the results vindicate the company. Investors also wanted to see how Hasbro performed overseas after poor results there last year.  The shares rose to as high as $103.03 in early trading Tuesday. It hasn’t traded above $100-a-share on an intraday basis since November. They had risen 8.4% this year through Monday’s close.

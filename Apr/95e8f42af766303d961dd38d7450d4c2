Gunmen who kidnapped an American tourist and her driver in an Ugandan national park on Tuesday are demanding a ransom of $500 000, the East African nation’s government said. Kimberley Sue Endecott, 35, and her driver, Jean Paul, were abducted in Uganda’s Queen Elizabeth National Park about 380 kilometres west of the capital, Kampala. The park is near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjacent to Virunga National Park, where two British tourists were held by Congolese rebels in May 2018. “We strongly believe the perpetrators and victims could still be trapped within our search area,” the Uganda Police said in a statement on Twitter. The kidnapping may be financially motivated, the Uganda Police said. An elderly tourist couple that was travelling with the victims reported the incident after the abductors left with their companions. Last year, a group of Congolese rebels ambushed a vehicle ferrying tourists to Congo’s Virunga, killed a park ranger and held two British citizens overnight near the Congolese town of Goma. The park, known for its endangered mountain gorillas, was closed to tourists following the incident and reopened in February. © 2019 Bloomberg L.P

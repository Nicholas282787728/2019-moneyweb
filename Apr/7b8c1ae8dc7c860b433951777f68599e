The region has barely had time to recover from the effects of Cyclone Idai, which hit in March and killed more than 1 000 people in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi. The storm, which will be named Kenneth if it becomes an organized tropical cyclone, may bring “life-threatening weather” to Mozambique and Tanzania, the weather forecaster said.

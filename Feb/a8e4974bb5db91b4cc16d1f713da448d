Americans are spreading their love this Valentineâ€™s Day. While fewer have official plans for the festive day, those who do celebrate are spending more than ever, with an increasing percentage going to non-romantic relations. While significant others are still expected to get most of the gifts, for the first time since 2014, 42% of outlays are earmarked for friends, family members, co-workers and pets, according to a National Retail Federation survey conducted by Prosper Insights & Analytics.

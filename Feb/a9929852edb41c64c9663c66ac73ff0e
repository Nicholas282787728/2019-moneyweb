FirstRand, one of South Africa’s largest lenders, said on Friday it expects basic earnings per share for the first half of its financial year to increase between 22% and 24%. The increase will largely be due to a windfall of around R2.3 billion ($164.12 million) from the purchase of a credit card book by insurer Discovery, a joint venture between the two firms. FirstRand said the funds from the transaction would not be included in its headline earnings per share – the key profit measure in South Africa – nor its normalised earnings, due to its one-off nature.

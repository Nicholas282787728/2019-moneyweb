South African power utility has warned of an increased risk of stage 1 load shedding between 2pm and 10pm on Thursday. According to Eskom, the national power grid is constrained after units at its power stations failed. “While the power system remains tight tonight, the probability of load-shedding remains possible should we lose additional units,”Eskom said in a statement posted on its Twitter page.

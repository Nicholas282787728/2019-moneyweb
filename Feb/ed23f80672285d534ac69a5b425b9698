The S&P 500 Index just capped its best January in 30 years. US stocks rallied on Thursday on the back of stronger-than-expected corporate earnings and a dovish Federal Reserve to post a 7.9% advance for the month. That was better than the 7.1% gain in 1989, when George H W Bush came into office and transit fares in New York City rose to $1.15 from $1.00.  Â© 2019 Bloomberg L.P

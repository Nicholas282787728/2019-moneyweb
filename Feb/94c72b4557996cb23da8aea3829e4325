Nigeria’s stock market may rally if President Muhammadu Buhari loses this weekend’s election, according to analysts at Citigroup, ending a run that’s seen it fall more than any other in the world in dollar terms since the 76-year-old former general came to office in May 2015. Some foreign investors would prefer a government led by Buhari’s main challenger, businessman and ex-Vice President Atiku Abubakar. But while the 72-year-old has pledged to privatise state assets and float the naira, many are skeptical and point to his reputation for corruption.  © 2019 Bloomberg L.P

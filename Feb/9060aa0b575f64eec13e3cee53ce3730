Here’s what caught our attention on Thursday: 1.The morning after Mboweni’s budget speech South Africans are reeling following finance minister, Tito Mboweni’s budget speech on Wednesday. The minister’s stance on Eskom was that government would not be funding its debt, but will allow R69 billion over three years to support it. Furthermore, personal income tax brackets were not increased and GDP growth for 2019 was revised to 1.5% from 1.7%. All eyes will now be on rating agency, Moody’s which may or may not downgrade SA’s sovereign ratings in the coming days. Reuters reported on Wednesday that Moody’s said the budget shows ‘limited fiscal flexibility’ within the challenging economic environment. We’ll wait till then.

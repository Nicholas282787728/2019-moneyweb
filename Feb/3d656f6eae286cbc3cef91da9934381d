Spotify Technology SA climbed in early trading after two acquisitions in podcasting and continued subscriber growth reassured investors that the streaming service can fend off rivals like Apple Music. Spotify agreed to buy the podcasting firms Gimlet Media and Anchor, with Chief Executive Officer Daniel Ek saying in a release that “opportunity starts with the next phase of growth in audio — podcasting.” Monthly average users rose to 207 million, the company said on Wednesday, beating analysts’ expectation of 203 million. The company, whose growth had come with persistent bottom-line losses, crowed about several financial metrics. It said operating income, net income and free cash flow were all positive for the first time in its history.  The shares rose as much as 1.8% to $141.93 in premarket trading after the results were released. Investors have been upbeat about Spotify’s prospects, sending the stock up 23% this year.

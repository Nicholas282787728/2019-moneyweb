PepsiCo warned that earnings will decline this year as it invests more to boost its businesses the day after a disappointing outlook from chief rival Coca-Cola Co. Adjusted earnings per share and revenue met analysts’ estimates in the fourth quarter. For this year, Pepsi forecast a 1% decline in core EPS, excluding currency shifts, along with a slowdown in sales growth. The lackluster forecast comes a day after a disappointing outlook sent Coke shares plunging the most in more than 10 years. A challenging macroeconomic environment and weakening sentiment among US consumer is hampering both companies.  Pepsi shares were little changed in early trading. The stock had gained 1.9% this year through Thursday’s close, lagging the S&P 500 over that period.

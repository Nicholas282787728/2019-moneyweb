The rand weakened early on Thursday as a bounce-back by the dollar aided by positive economic data put the local currency on the back foot ahead of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s State of the Nation Address this evening. <a href="http://iono.fm/e/652511">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> At 0640 GMT the rand was 0.17% softer at 13.57 per dollar compared to its close of 13.54 overnight in New York. The rand has now retreated around 2.5% since last Thursday’s rally to a two-and-a-half year peak, tracking fellow high-yielding emerging market currencies hit by a bout of risk aversion triggered by better US economic data. On Wednesday the United States reported a narrower trade gap, helping the dollar index to a fifth straight session of gains. With no top-tier economic data due locally, focus is expected to shift to Ramaphosa’s speech after the market close, with investors looking for clues about the fate of cash-strapped state power firm Eskom. On Wednesday a monthly measure of business confidence noted concerns about slowing progress in promised reforms to ailing state firms and the broader economy. <a href="http://iono.fm/e/652353">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> Bonds also weakened, with the yield on the benchmark government issue due in 2026 adding 2 basis points to 8.67%. Stocks were set to open lower at 0700 GMT, with the JSE securities exchange’s Top-40 futures index down 0.48%.

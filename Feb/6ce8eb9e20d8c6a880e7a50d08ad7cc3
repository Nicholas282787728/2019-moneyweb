South African finance minister Tito Mboweni will have to balance the demands of a power utility that is struggling to keep the lights on with the need to rein in the deficit and stabilise the nation’s debt in his 2019-20 budget. Eskom which provides more than 90% of South Africa’s electricity, needs a cash injection to survive, a step which could widen the fiscal shortfall. Mboweni presents the budget to lawmakers in Cape Town later Wednesday.

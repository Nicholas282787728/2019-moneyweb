Mobile operator Cell C reported a net loss of R634 million in the six months ended November 30 2018. The figure was disclosed in Cell C shareholder Blue Label Telecoms’ interim results for the same six-month period, which were published on Thursday. Blue Label, which owns 45% of Cell C, said its share of the net loss amounted to R285 million. Cell C’s financial year ends on December 31. The operator is expected to report its full-year numbers soon. “Blue Label’s accounting policies exclude equity-settled share-based payment charges from its associates and has not early adopted IFRS 16. Accordingly, an adjustment of R51 million and R106 million respectively was required. The net result was a negative contribution of R128 million to Blue Label’s core earnings,” the JSE-listed group said. For the 10 months ended May 2018, Cell C’s net profit amounted to R1.14 billion. This comprised trading losses of R782 million offset by the recognition of a deferred tax asset of R1.92 billion. Blue Label’s share of this net profit was R512 million. “In line with Blue Label’s accounting policies as above, an exclusion relating to equity-settled share-based payment charges from its associates and the reversal of the early adoption of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16, resulted in a positive adjustment of R65 million and a negative adjustment of R6 million respectively. The net result was a positive contribution of R571 million to Blue Label’s core earnings.” This article was published with the permission of TechCentral. The original publication can be viewed here.

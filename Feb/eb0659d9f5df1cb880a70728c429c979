Listed television retailer Verimark was the best performer in Moneyweb’s stock picking competition last year. The choice of Hein Vogel, Verimark stock increased by 77%. The market as a whole was down 8.5%. The competition, which has been running for over a decade, offers the Moneyweb community a chance to show off their stock-picking skills (and luck). It’s an informal competition, with no prizes other than bragging rights. At the beginning of the year, each entrant chooses one JSE-listed company. The best performer for the year wins. Verimark, with its attempted delisting, has a colourful history on the JSE. It was perhaps the quintessential unloved, contrarian pick at the beginning of 2018. When it was chosen by Vogel it had a dividend yield of 14%. The stock pick results contain a warning for those hoping to catch a falling knife. Steinhoff was chosen by 116 out of 696 entrants in 2018. This was after it lost more than 90% of its value the previous year. But instead of bouncing back, it went on to lose another 63%.

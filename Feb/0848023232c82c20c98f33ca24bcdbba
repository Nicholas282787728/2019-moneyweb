UBS Group on Wednesday recommended the trade, which Wall Street heavyweights including Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have tried in the past without success. The rand has been the best performing currency in the world this year with a 7% gain against the dollar as risk appetite returned to global markets. Against the lira, the South African currency has advanced 5.1%  after last year’s 20% surge. But a technical signal suggests this trend may be about to change.  The short-term average for the lira-rand has climbed above the long-term mean for the first time in more than a year, a so called golden cross that indicates a buy signal to some traders who follow chart patterns. “The South African rand and Turkish lira were both beneficiaries of the shift in the Fed’s outlook to a more neutral stance and the favourable sentiment toward risky assets, including those from emerging markets,” Tilmann Kolb and Jonas David, London-based strategists at Zurich-based UBS, said in a note to clients. But the currencies may diverge in the short term, they said.

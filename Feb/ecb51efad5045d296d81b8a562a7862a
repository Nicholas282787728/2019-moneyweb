South Africaâ€™s largest refinery, the 180 000 barrel per day Sapref plant in the east coast city of Durban will shutdown for routine maintenance from the last week of May until the end of July, a refinery official said on Wednesday. The refinery, in which BP Southern Africa (BPSA) will invest $1 billion for upgrades, is a 50/50 joint venture between the local unit of BP and Royal Dutch Shell.

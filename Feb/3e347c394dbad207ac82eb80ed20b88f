A meeting between South African trade union federation Cosatu, President Cyril Ramaphosa and senior members of his cabinet did not break a deadlock over plans to split the country’s national power utility into three, Cosatu said on Tuesday. “There was no breakthrough in the impasse over the unbundling of Eskom. We still need more detail,” Cosatu spokesman Sizwe Pamla told Reuters, adding the federation would hold further discussions with its members next week.

By 2017 Ayo Technology Solutions was riding the wave of the fourth industrial revolution. It had a vision of effecting real change in South Africa and transforming organisations across Africa through technology. This vision may have been very impressive, and may have contributed to the decision by the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) to invest R4.3 billion in the company. However, an analysis of the company’s financial performance during the preceding years suggests the company did not perform anywhere close to a level that would warrant such an investment from pensioners’ hard-earned savings. The financial analysis shows that Ayo managed to grow its assets from R107 million in 2016 to R292 million in 2017. This was predominantly achieved through acquisitions. However, during this period the company did not perform well operationally – it reported accumulated losses of R170 million in 2016 and R152 million in 2017. How sustainable is the Ayo business? Ayo’s financials further reveal that the company’s revenue was influenced by significant deal-making, with the group selling businesses unrelated to its core information technology and communications (ITC) focus, while acquiring the appropriate ITC assets from related parties. The table below summarises Ayo’s income statement performance for its five most recent financial periods.  2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 Revenue 638 894 478 663 169 217 222 619 191 035 Gross income margin 30.98% 33.16% 33.17% 31.12% 29.03% Operating income margin -0.21% 9.77% 20.69% 11.14% 9.56% Ebitda margin *0% 10.48% 22.45% 11.97% 9.47% Ebitda: Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Note: Where there was a difference between the year-end figure and the figure used as a comparative figure the following year, the comparative figure was used. * The costs related to the share issue were excluded. From the analysis of the financials it is clear that the PIC’s investment could not have been more opportune for the company. The R227 million finance income Ayo earned in 2018 from the R4.3 billion cash injection wiped out the entire R152 million accumulated loss from 2017. If this interest was excluded, it is clear that Ayo is struggling to contain its costs, as indicated by the figures below: 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014  Revenue (Rm) 638 478 169 222 191 Cost of sales as a % of revenue 68.97% 66.95% 66.86% 68.92% 70.68% Operating expenses as a % of revenue 30.56% 26.15% 20.71% 21.17% 20.42% Assets versus liabilities The health of the balance sheet over the past few years is also less than stellar. Up until 2015 Ayo’s liabilities exceeded its assets, with external auditors Grant Thornton noting in their audit report that the excess of liabilities over assets of R14 million indicated “the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt on the group’s ability to continue as a going concern”. 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 Total liabilities (Rm) -202.1 -225.3 -90 -132.7 -135 Total assets (Rm) 4 671.1 292.4 107.1 118.7 111.2 4 469.0 67.1 17.1 -14 -23.8 A glance at the cash flow statement also reveals a few concerns. The cash paid to suppliers and employees inexplicably spiked in 2017, as can be seen in the table below. However, the injection of R4.3 billion in December 2017 placed the group firmly in a solvent position. It is too early to determine the impact on Ayo’s future growth. Cash generated from operations (R000) 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 Cash receipts from customers 306 459 253 215 179 Cash paid to suppliers and employees 365 406 231 201 163 Cash generated from operations -59 53 22 14 16 Cash generated from operations as a percentage of cash receipts from customers -19.3% 11.55% 8.7% 6.51% 8.94% The group’s financial standing could further be negatively impacted by the introduction of new accounting statements based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in 2019: * The group will only introduce IFRS 9, which became effective on January 1, 2018, in 2019. The group does not however anticipate a major impact, but this can only be verified in the 2019 financial statements. * IFRS 15, which also became effective on January 1, 2018, will also only be applied in the 2019 financial statements. IFRS 15 will impact how revenue is accounted for on long-term projects. PIC pays more than fair value of shares This rather precarious financial position also begs the question whether the PIC paid fair value for the nearly 100 million shares it acquired at R43 a share in 2017. Read: PIC inquiry: R4.3bn Ayo deal approved in record 3 weeks The issuing of shares in the days prior to this PIC investment saw Ayo issue 31 960 000 shares at R1.50 per share to a BEE consortium, raising R47.9 million for the company. The consortium included the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (Popcru), the Southern African Clothing and Textile Workers’ Union (Sactwu), the Black Business Council, Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa) nominees, the National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) and the Social Entrepreneurship Foundation. On the date of issuance of the shares at R1.50 to this consortium, Ayo put the fair value of its shares at R1.87. The exact date was not disclosed. Within days of issuance, the PIC paid R4.3 billion or R43 each for 99 782 655 shares. At fair value of R1.87 a share, the investment should have been around R187 million, or R4.1 billion less than what the PIC actually paid. Ayo’s financial performance certainly doesn’t warrant such a premium.

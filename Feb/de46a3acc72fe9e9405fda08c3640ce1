Coca-Cola sold fewer drinks in the Americas in the fourth quarter despite a boost from zero-calorie offerings as rival PepsiCo ramps up marketing spending. Shares slipped in early trading. Unit case volume fell 1% in North America and 2% in Latin America in the quarter ended December 31, though adjusted earnings per share matched analyst forecasts. A lackluster profit forecast for 2019 weighed on the beverage giant’s shares. While the beverage giant has made progress with its Diet Coke and Coke Zero Sugar brands, the results show that a broader decline in soda consumption may still be weighing down performance. Coke, like its rivals in the beverage business, is also facing higher transportation costs.  Coke shares were down 3.1% as of 7:54 amin New York. The stock had gained 5% this year through Wednesday’s close. The company said adjusted earnings per share could be down 1% in 2019, with 1% growth the high end of the range.

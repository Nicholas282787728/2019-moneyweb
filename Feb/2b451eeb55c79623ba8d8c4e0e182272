Ralph Lauren climbed in early trading after posting quarterly results that exceeded analyst estimates in almost every area as increased marketing paid off during the holiday season. Companywide same-store sales excluding currency swings, a key performance measure, rose 4% last quarter, the company said Tuesday. Analysts had projected 2% growth. Ralph Lauren has been on a rebound since growing stodgy and losing ground to fast-fashion sellers in recent years. Executives refocused the brand on classic styles and began targeting younger shoppers through trendy collaborations and headline-grabbing products such as a heatable moon jacket.  Shares of Ralph Lauren climbed as much as 9.1% in early trading. Through Mondayâ€™s close, the stock had jumped 11% since the start of the year, outpacing the 8.7% gain in the S&P 500 Index.

The Dutch government said on Saturday it was in talks with 250 companies about moving operations to the Netherlands from Britain ahead of Britain’s exit from the European Union, scheduled for March 29. The Economic Affairs Ministry said in a report that a recruitment programme had brought 42 companies or branch offices and 1 923 jobs from Britain to the Netherlands in 2018. The report named Japanese investment bank Norinchukin, media company TVT Media, financial services providers MarketAxess and Azimo, and maritime insurer UK P&I Club among movers that had not already been reported. “In 2019, several companies, including Discovery and Bloomberg have already announced their intention to invest in the Netherlands because of Brexit,” the ministry said. “Additionally, the Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency is talking with more than 250 foreign companies considering setting up operations in the Netherlands following Brexit.” It said most were British, but some were American or Asian firms reconsidering their European branch structures. “These include companies in the financial sector, media and advertising, life sciences & health and logistics,” it said.

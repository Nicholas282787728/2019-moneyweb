Sasol Ltd. reported a jump in first-half profit as the South African fuels and chemicals company enters a crucial year for its massive Lake Charles chemicals project in Louisiana. Headline earnings per share increased by 32% to R23.25 ($1.66). Sasol benefited from a rebound in oil prices for most of 2018, as well as a weaker rand relative to the dollar. The company has also been helped by cost-cutting measures and efforts to save cash during the earlier three-year crude slump.

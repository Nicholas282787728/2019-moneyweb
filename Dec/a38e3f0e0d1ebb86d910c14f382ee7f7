In a statement on Friday afternoon Eskom said loadshedding, which was announced at stage 2 in the morning, had progressed to stage 4. The situation is expected to continue until 6am on Saturday. However the utility has warned that further power cuts are possible over the weekend. Eskom said it lost additional generation units on Friday morning and as units had not returned to service as scheduled, unavailable capacity increased to about 13 000MW. “This with a higher demand of about 1000MW, necessitates loadshedding to move up from Stage 2 to Stage 4 from 14:00 today.” The struggling power utility said it continues to use diesel and water resources at its open cycle gas turbines and pumped storage schemes respectively, to supplement capacity. It added that with the incessant rain, it is starting to experience coal-handling problems at a number of power stations due to wet coal, resulting in generation units being unable to produce power. “If the wet weather persists, we are likely to implement loadshedding throughout the weekend.” Stage 4 calls for 4000MW to be rotationally loadshed nationally.

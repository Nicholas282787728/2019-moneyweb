The share price of global integrated chemicals and energy company Sasol got a boost on Tuesday on some positive news relating to its Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP) in the US. Sasol said the LCCP Ethane Cracker is increasing production following the replacement of its acetylene reactor catalyst. The Ethane Cracker achieved beneficial operation in August 2019 but has run approximately 50 – 60% of capacity due to the underperformance of the plant’s acetylene removal system. This issue has now been resolved. The share price rose to a high of R303.59, and by 15:10 was up 10.69% at R302.83. “The outage to replace the catalyst was successfully completed on schedule and within budget. Following the outage, the unit was started up smoothly and ethylene production rates are approximately 85 – 90% of nameplate capacity and are increasing,” Sasol said. The chemicals giant said the LCCP Low-Density Polyethylene Unit is being commissioned “with beneficial operation expected later in December 2019. The remaining three downstream units under construction to complete the integrated LCCP site, Ziegler Alcohols and Alumina, Alcohol Ethoxylates, and Guerbet Alcohols, remain on cost and schedule….” In October Sasol fired co-CEOs Bongani Nqwababa and Stephen Cornell after serious mismanagement was found in the development of the Lake Charles project. The company said shortcomings in executing the LCCP negatively impacted its reputation, leading to “a serious erosion of confidence in the leadership of the company” and weakening the company financially.

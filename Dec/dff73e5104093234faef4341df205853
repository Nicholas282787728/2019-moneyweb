For those bored by the endless procession of prosaic 2020 outlooks from Wall Street, Saxo Bank has just issued its 10 outrageous predictions for next year. Anticipating 12 months marked by “disruption of the status quo” at “nearly every turn,” the Danish bank argues that investors should be ready for anything. That includes: The end of the populist fightback, finance ministers taking the baton from central bankers, and green finance losing its clout all “could represent one big pendulum swing,” according to the team led by chief economist Steen Jakobsen. “Inevitably the outcomes that prove the most disruptive (and therefore outrageous) are those that are a surprise to consensus,” they write. If 2019 is anything to go by, they may be onto something. Contrarian calls for this year like the Federal Reserve cutting rates actually came true.

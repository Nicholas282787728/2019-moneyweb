South Africa will take several months to determine how best to deal with the R454 billion of debt amassed by state power utility Eskom, Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan said. Freeman Nomvalo, who was named Eskom’s chief restructuring officer on July 30, has proposed options to reorganise the debt and the National Treasury is now doing further work on them, Gordhan said in reply to a question from a lawmaker in parliament in Cape Town on Tuesday. “We will engage with lenders to Eskom to see what appetite they have to resolving the debt issue,” he said. © 2019 Bloomberg

Thai, South African and South Korean bonds would be the most vulnerable in the event of a spike in US Treasury yields, while those in India and Russia would be the least responsive, a Bloomberg analysis shows. The study of 13 global emerging bond markets measuring their sensitivities to moves in the US five-year yield showed those with highly consistent moves have economies more dependent on exports. By contrast, India and Russia — which rank at the bottom of the list — have a strong dependency on commodity prices and are less reliant on trade. The analysis covers seven periods from mid-2011 when the five-year Treasury yield moved more than 35 basis points over a two-week period. Below is a table showing the size and consistency of how each country’s bonds responded on average. Click here for more on the methodology used.

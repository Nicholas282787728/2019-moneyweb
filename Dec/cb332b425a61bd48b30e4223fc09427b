Emerging markets are gearing up to ride a risk rally in the final full week of December, with a troika of uncertainties all but lifted from traders’ radars. There’ll be plenty of caution around, though. While last week’s meeting of the US Federal Reserve and the UK election have been removed from the list of hurdles, there are sufficient doubts about the progress of the US-China trade negotiations to keep buyers away. And if there’s anything to be gleaned from expected swings in the Chinese currency, the skeptics are legion. Options-implied one-year volatility for the offshore yuan stood at 4.9% Monday morning in New York, above the roughly 4.5% in April and July, a time when traders saw a trade deal as imminent. While Washington and Beijing agreed the first part of a trade deal on Friday that will see the US reduce some tariffs and China increase agricultural purchases, broader differences between the world’s two biggest economies seem far from being resolved. “This is only a short-term solution,” Luciano Jannelli, head of investment strategy at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Sunday. “If you look at the lack of progress on the issue of China’s industrial policy — its subsidizing of specific business lines — the big issues have not been tackled yet.” Emerging-market stocks and currencies had their best week since June in the five days through Friday. Investors took heart from the Fed’s signals that it would keep interest rates on hold throughout 2020 and then from signs the US and China were nearing a phase-one deal. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s election victory on Thursday gave another boost to riskier global assets, given it will probably pave a smoother path for Britain to exit the European Union.

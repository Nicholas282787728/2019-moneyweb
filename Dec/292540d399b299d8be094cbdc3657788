As many medical schemes do at this time of year, Gems is announcing changes to its medical plans related to the costs of various benefit options and added enhancements to their coverage. This includes the addition of a new benefit option called Tanzanite One, named after one of the rarest gemstones in the world. Here to discuss this in more detail is the chief operations officer of Gems Dr Stan Moloabi. Brought to you by Government Employees Medical Scheme (Gems).

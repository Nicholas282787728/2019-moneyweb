Eskom has warned that it may continue rolling blackouts throughout the week as power cuts entered a fifth day. Eskom said it’s cutting 2 000 megawatts from the grid on Monday, extending the electricity shortages, known locally as load shedding. Plant breakdowns resulted in the utility losing as much as 12 000 megawatts on Sunday.

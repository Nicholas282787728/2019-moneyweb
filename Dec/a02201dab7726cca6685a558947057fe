 The Government Employees Medical Scheme (Gems) continues to make a significant contribution to providing access to quality healthcare to South Africans. As South Africaâ€™s largest restricted scheme, Gems has the lowest non-healthcare expenditure which means more benefits for members and their beneficiaries. Dr Vuyokazi Gqola, chief healthcare officer at Gems, explains what these benefits are, particularly for the year 2020 where various enhancements have been introduced to some of the more affordable options.

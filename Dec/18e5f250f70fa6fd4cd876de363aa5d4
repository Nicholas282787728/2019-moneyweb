The leadership structure of six people, which is similar to that of the ANC, did see changes in the other four positions, according to a party Tweet. Chairman Dali Mpofu was replaced by Veronica Mente, who started her career as bodyguard to the mayor of Cape Town. Since it was founded in 2013 by 38-year Malema, the EFF leadership structure has remained relatively stable compared with the main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, whose head recently quit. The EFF targets black township residents whose standard of living has improved little since the end of apartheid, with promises to nationalise land, banks and mines across the country. The party became the second-largest opposition force in its maiden election five years ago. Some media groups were banned from covering this weekend’s elective conference.
